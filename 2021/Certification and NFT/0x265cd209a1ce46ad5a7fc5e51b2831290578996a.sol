Now, just 10 months later, that amount is more than $10 billion. DeFi is experiencing exponential growth, fuelled by lightning-quick innovation. And yet, the market cap of all DeFi-related tokens combined stands at a mere 4% of the total market cap of the cryptocurrency industry. Clearly, the DeFi revolution has only just begun, and there, lies the opportunity for enormous further upside.\n', ' \n', ' \n', 'The exponential growth of DeFi (courtesy DeFiPulse)\n', 'So DeFi seems to be a big deal. But what exactly is DeFi?\n', 'DeFi, or decentralized finance, broadly includes the digital assets, smart contracts, protocols, and decentralized applications built on blockchains such as Ethereum. In simpler terms, DeFi is an open financial ecosystem where anyone can build financial tools and services in a decentralized manner, allowing users to engage in activities such as borrowing, lending and trading. These activities are normally firmly in the domain of traditional finance, and require intermediaries such as banks. With DeFi, users have complete control over their assets and investments, and can also potentially earn a higher return than from the legacy financial system.\n', 'So DeFi really seems to be a big deal. How do I take part in all of this?\n', 'Therein lies the problem with DeFi. Most DeFi applications today are difficult to use for the average user that lacks experience interacting with smart contracts or transacting on the blockchain. The user experience is poor, the interface is often unnecessarily complex, and the pre-requisite technical knowledge serves as a high barrier to entry. To make matters worse, scams galore, with opportunistic developers releasing questionable products to make quick money. Navigating this emerging DeFi landscape demands such commitment from the interested user, in terms of time and effort spent in familiarizing themselves with the applications and deciphering the jargon, that many have preferred to stay away altogether. It is clear that to continue its explosive growth, and bring on board the majority of the cryptocurrency users that have so far remained on the sidelines, DeFi needs a change.\n', '\n', ' Introducing the Beethoven Finance Ecosystem\n', 'The fundamental vision of the Beethoven Finance ecosystem is to bridge together the excitement and innovation of decentralized finance with the accessibility and familiarity of traditional finance, and to create a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem in which every platform has been built to be simple and intuitive to use, requiring no technical knowledge or prior experience.\n', 'At the core of this ecosystem will be Beethoven Finance’s native token, BTH. BTH Token holders will be the primary beneficiaries of the success of Beethoven Finance, and will benefit from the continued usage and growth of the platforms within the ecosystem, through built-in mechanisms in each of these platforms. Ultimately, once all the platforms have been released, the BTH Token holders will have the ability to govern them in a decentralized manner. The Beethoven Finance ecosystem will be rolled out in several phases, as explained further.\n', 'Decentralized Asset Management (Jan 2021)\n', 'Yield Farming. Liquidity Mining. Crop Rotation. Sushi. Yam.\n', 'Chances are, unless you have been spending hours every day keeping track of developments in DeFi, none of those words make much sense to you. In fact, we wouldn’t blame you if you thought this article had suddenly pivoted to discussing the intricacies of agriculture…\n', '\n', 'BTH is the token of Beethoven. Unlike the consensus mechanism adopted by chains such as Bitcoin, Beethoven uses a mechanism of lockup to build consensus. Participants can choose the lockup time freely according to their preferences.. Of course, different choices will result in different rewards. The longer one stake the higher boost of farming on can get.\n', 'Although this consensus mechanism cannot eliminate whales, it is a plausible way to prevent the whales from dumping. To make it clear, one can only get a higher reward by choosing a longer lock duration. If whales want to maximize their earnings they will choose a longer lock. Thus, the risk of dumping gets minimized and the token price gets stabilized. To be noted, lockup is not a mandatory thing. One can always stake with no lock out of concern of liquidity at the price of less earning. BTH will be distributed to users through yield farming. The users hold will be the avouchment for getting a share of BTH Vault earnings.\n', 'Consensus mechanisms\n', 'We know that Blockchain is a distributed decentralized network that provides immutability, privacy, security, and transparency. There is no central authority present to validate and verify the transactions, yet every transaction in the Blockchain is considered to be completely secured and verified. This is possible only because of the presence of the consensus protocol which is a core part of any Blockchain network.\n', 'A consensus algorithm is a procedure through which all the peers of the Blockchain network reach a common agreement about the present state of the distributed ledger. In this way, consensus algorithms achieve reliability in the Blockchain network and establish trust between unknown peers in a distributed computing environment. Essentially, the consensus protocol makes sure that every new block that is added to the Blockchain is the one and only version of the truth that is agreed upon by all the nodes in the Blockchain.\n', '\n', 'Community consensus\n', '\n', 'The long-term evolution of a community requires support from a numerous number of people in a long term, as community consensus is the main force to maintain the development for a community. A strong consensus of a community will become to be the backbone which will determine the success of one project.\n', 'Perhaps the most essential question for Community living is “How do we reach consensus?” We decided that in our Community we would all have a direct role in the ongoing decision-making. The key to doing this is that all residents belong to hubs of about a dozen people. In addition to being a support group, these resident hubs are where the key issues of guiding the Community are explored and decided.\n', 'To achieve community consensus ,we will ensure that consensus discussions include participation by those having a substantive position, proposal, or stake in the matter under discussion, and to ensure that discussions balance level of participation with diversity of participation, ie, don’t let one or two voices drown out others. Consensus is achieved through a repeatable process that takes the discussion through several stages designed to ensure the outcome is representative and well-thought-out. And to facilitates or moderates each discussion to ensure the above.\n', 'Ecosystem programme of Beethoven\n', 'Beethoven aims to reward the long term holders due to the reason that an awesome project requires long-term supporter to subsist. That means the liquidity farming is hospitable to long term holders.\n', 'There are 0, 1, 5 and 15 days stake locked for the investors to choose, the farming boost are 0%, 1%, 8% and 20%, stake period can be altered by personal wishes in accordance with their rewards. The withdraw function will be unable to proceed if the stake is already locked. This mechanism will ensure the vast majority of interest to be gained by Beethoven long-term supporter and believer.\n', 'The long-term holder will become to be the cornerstone of Beethoven, to become a Beethoven farmer and believer is a better choice if you want to gain substantial profit\n', 'Governance\n', 'Beethoven cash seeks to motivate the broader community to take part in the Polygon ecosystem. BTH is a token ruled by every community members and BTH holders naturally have the right to attend in any voting or decision-making process on every issue .\n', 'After the project goes online and runs smoothly, more than 60% votes of BTH holders will build and verify the proposal of new token.\n', 'In the long-term, the community in the form of Beethoven Farm Improvement Proposal and Beethoven Farm Configuration Change Proposal will take charge of the governance of Beethoven . Through DAO, BTH holders can vote for critical topics such as functionality improvements/changes. Voters will receive BTH for participating in governance.\n', 'After the genesis farming, Beethoven Vault will go online. Vault refers to capital pools that automatically generate yield based on searching profitable opportunities in the market. It servers as a trust broker in crypto market. Users do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi but only need to stake tokens into the Beethoven Vault and gain benefit regularly. Beethoven Vault will benefit users by saving gas costs, automating the yield generation and automatically shift capital to new and more profitable projects.
