Cryptocurrency mainly uses decentralized control with all transactions recorded in a database called Blockchain. The first decentralized cryptocurrency created was Bitcoin in 2009. Since then, the crypto world has grown exponentially. Massive adoption of blockchain technology cannot be avoided in the coming years as cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly easier to access and own. There are at least 1500 cryptocurrencies currently in the market. One of these is Ethereum Block Chain. Ethereum Block Chain implemented a platform that runs a Block-contract, which is a application that runs on blockchain. RAO Protocol is a project of RAO Team that has been researched and designed, and has developed a reference implementation of a self-sustained, self-governed, self-funded blockchain ecosystem. It also implementation of experimental protocols, which are a combination of core features implemented in Block-contracts and merged protocol-level configuration like NFT. An important point is the ability to implement key platform features using built-in mechanisms, i.e. Block-contracts. RAO aims to define and standardize protocols for a reference implementation of built-in reflect staking, governance system and a development funding mechanism based upon Block-contracts. \n', 'Legal Disclaimer\n', ' The information provided on this website does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice and you should not treat any of the website’s content as such.

Our revolutionary Reflect Ethereum Block blockchain service is designed to earn extra tokens by simply holding, without any token inflation, secure digital assets and access to funding all over the world. Just hold tokens in your wallet and watch your balance increase. \n', 'Why a reflect token ?\n', '\n', 'We believe in a new world, which helps people to grow, and protects them from the effects of inflation, or major historic events with detrimental effects such as Covid-19. As an expert’s team of developers, we designed a useful deflationist token, and a system of fees applied to each transaction, which fees are instantly split among all the token’s holders. We believe that we can succeed together in protecting holders against market variations, variations in costs of living and inflation. In light of the uncertainties generated by the Covid-19 crisis, as well as the rising challenges of obtaining real estate loans in this context, our development team resolved to provide a sustainable solution over time, able to hedge against inflation. Our Community is the backbone of the RAO platform. We take pride in its diversity, the Community being made of holders, developers, people passionate about the technology and other amazing people. Join us on Telegram and Twitter and share with friends! RAO is the first ERC20 token to re-imagine the concept of frictionless yield generation and deflationary mechanisms and the first European protocol to invest in fractional and frictionless investing. \n', '1 The Problem\n', ' Faced with the uncertainty of the coronavirus 2019 crisis. Faced with the complexity and difficulty of obtaining real estate loans in times of crisis. We have decided with our development team of two engineers to provide a sustainable solution over time in the face of inflation. First we decided to create a crypto currency that rewards investors and is deflationary over time. In a second step we want to set up Blocks contract during the second half of 2022 to allow our investors to stack their token even more and give rewards. Problem of fees on the Ethereum Blockchain: Most of the current DeFi projects have been built on the Ethereum Blockchain, increasing the power of the network effects and enhancing the security of the protocol. Although, this has also led to the appeciation of the ETH price which has skyrocketed Ethereum transaction fees. The result is that the Ethereum Ecosystem is becoming a pay-to-win network mostly accessible by the wealthiest wallets. \n', '2 The Solution\n', ' Cryptocurrency is still the best investment you can make. For the first time, investors around the globe can buy a reflect token through fully-compliant, fractional, tokenized ownership. Powered by blockchain. Our solution allows access to yields and rewards. Through our community we will be able to continue to invest together. We wish to democratize the access to cryptocurrency investment.\n', '3 How do we want to implement this? We are currently a development team looking for long-term investors to support the growth of the project. We started by creating the first version of our protocol. We are working in an agile (like a lean startup) with sprints, way to scale our project. In the long term we want to offer the best user experience on our platform various tangible assets such as land in order to fight against inflation and poverty. We believe that together we can be stronger, that’s why we want to set up rewards to the most loyal holders. We will first create a web platform to allow our community to invest in RAO. To do so, we will give the possibility to token owners to store their tokens in Blocks contracts. A Block contract by tangible assets. The maximum supply of RAO is 10,000, which is continuously burned by 25% of the current fee applied to each transaction. RAO works by applying a 1-10% fee to each transaction and instantly splitting that fee among all holders of the token. Holders do not need to stake or wait for fees to be delivered. Fees are awarded by the Block contract and are immediately reflected in the holders balance. Because of this, 75% of the fees generated go to holders of the token. The percentage of fees you earn is calculated by the percentage of RAO that you own among holders. This generates a much higher yield than would be possible otherwise. The another 25% of the fees are burnt. In most DeFi applications, users must stake or park their tokens in a contract to earn a yield. RAO holders may use their tokens in third party lending, yield farming, or any other Block contract in addition to earning yield from the transaction fees. To facilitate this, the RAO Block contract exposes some new methods that allow staking contracts to easily determine the fees earned by each holder for any period of time even when funds are pooled together. All the information is available on Telegram for all holders. The RAO Block contract is complete at launch and uploaded on ERC20scan. There was no ICO, no pre-sale, and no fundraising of any kind. \n', 'The RAO Community \n', 'Our community is the basis for the RAO platform. We have holders, developers, marketers and all in all amazing people. Join our Telegram channel. And don’t forget to share.\n', ' Initial Launch Stage \n', 'At the first launch of the RAO Protocol, there will be no treasury. The purpose of this is to establish an official team and depend raise funds. The RAO development team will receive the full amount of the treasury fee at this stage of progress. 10% of the initial treasury funding is allocated to the RAO team to finalize the defined goal. 10% of the initial payment for the treasury will be held by the RAO team.\n', ' The total treasury fee at this stage is 20% which includes: \n', '• Development funding: 10%.\n', ' • Developer allocation: 10% The RAO development team adheres to a policy of complete financial transparency. Funding distribution will be as follows during the initial launch period: \n', 'The first investors who participated in raising the first funds and capital paid their RAO at market price. We made sure to distribute the tokens fairly for each founding member so that they could not hold more than 2.5M tokens at the start of the project. Both to reward them for the risk they took in investing in a new project but also to keep it fair for the investors of the pool. The rest of the tokens were deposited in liquidity pools, exchanges or burned. \n', 'Goals \n', 'The primary goal of RAO is to enhance the value of a token into crypto industry and Block-contract development platforms. Another goal of RAO, Protocol is to boost the growth and adoption of NFT as a community, and as a platform. Therefore, we have the following important goals: • Create a ”deflationist” reflect token. \n', '• Create an NFT platform on Ethereum Block Chain. \n', '• Create a marketplace of NFT.\n', '*/\n',
