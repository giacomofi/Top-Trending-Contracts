In the 4 years since, we have learned, grown, and built. We have survived and thrived through a crypto bear market, political turmoil, and a global pandemic. Above all, we have remained dedicated to our lofty aim of nothing short of planetary Flasheration. We have also become very pragmatic about the systemic, market-based interventions needed to steer our global economy toward a mutualistic and Flasherative relationship with biosphere health.\n', 'The guiding principles that serve as the foundation for Flash Oracle’s approach to creating a decentralized and public infrastructure for ecological data, claims, and markets are the following:\n', 'Out cooperate the competition.\n', 'If you find something that needs to be done, do it.\n', 'Uplift and support the agency of stakeholders and Oracle participants.\n', 'Agile development.\n', 'Holistic scientific rigor and replicability.\n', 'This blog is an outline of where we have been, and where we are going. It is a letter to our community that will reference the whitepaper and show what things have changed as we have experimented, learned, brought products to markets, shipped code and created cutting edge ecological monitoring methodologies like the CarbonPlus Grasslands which was the methodology behind our large credit sale to Microsoft. This blog will outline the evolution in our approach, show the growth of a community far beyond the bounds of a single company, and outline our suggestions for what comes after mainnet launch. This blog is one-part logistics overview to coordinate the community for the upcoming decentralized main net launch and one-part retrospective reviewing how our approach, technology and focus has evolved. And finally, this blog is one-part invitation to co-create a bold approach to public infrastructure that accounts for and creates contracts, assets and market solutions to our environmental challenges.\n', 'This blog also includes:\n', 'A pre-launch timeline and checklist,\n', 'Launch ceremony overview,\n', 'Summary of important whitepaper points and how our approach has evolved.\n', 'Please consider this is an update in approach and an overview of the evolution that has taken place as we continue to iterate towards the vision laid out in the whitepaper.\n', 'Roadmap to Mainnet\n', 'We are quickly marching towards our mainnet launch date. We are still on track for an April 15 launch date.\n', 'Tuesday, March 30: Genesis Candidate Chain Live\n', 'Wednesday, March 31 Mainnet GenTX Submissions Open\n', 'Tuesday, April 6th: Candidate Chain Closes, GenTX window Closes\n', 'Thursday, April 15 1500 UTC Mainnet Launch Time.\n', 'April 15 is our target genesis date and mainnet launch. However, there is a review window for the genesis file candidate. If any changes must be made to the genesis file or Flash Ledger software, we will create a new candidate, and run that candidate for 48 hours, followed by a 24 hour pause before mainnet launch. This means that at any time between the launch of the candidate, the community audit ceremony outlined below, and mainnet launch, we may postpone mainnet and each postponement will mean a minimum of 3 day extension of the process.\n', 'It takes a village to launch a blockchain!\n', 'How to get involved:\n', 'Join the Genesis Prelaunch Devnet!\n', 'On Tuesday March 30 we will be launching our final internal testnet called the “Prelaunch Devnet”. This Oracle will have an identical genesis file to that of our mainnet, with the exception of GenTx and initial validator-set being restricted to team nodes, and core validators. Validators are encouraged to self delegate and initiate a validator on our Prelaunch Devnet once the chain is running so they can join the Oracle and verify their FLASH balances.\n', 'The genesis file can be found in our mainnet repo, and instructions to join the prelaunch devnet will be posted on github once the chain is live.\n', 'Of particular note: We will be reusing a previous chain-id for our Prelaunch Devnet, “Flash-devnet-5”. This is to make the checking of wallet balances easier for our token holders, who all connected their Keplr browser wallets to a previous devnet in order to submit their wallet addresses to us.\n', 'Check your token balance.\n', 'Investors and token holders will be able to check balances in one of two ways:\n', 'Checking your balance in Keplr. This can be done via the same “Flash Devnet” chain that you connected to when registering your address\n', 'Entering your address on our Prelaunch Devnet block explorer. This will be available at flashoracle.com once the chain is live\n', 'In addition to checking your individual token balance, token holders and validators are encouraged to audit our proposed genesis file against the token distribution scheme described later in this blog in the “Token Distribution at Mainnet Launch” section.\n', 'This process will serve to give the community the ability to check your wallet address with your allocation, and to audit other allocations, and compare with published allocation schemes. This is the software version and the allocation that is being run in genesis. After this, the Devnet will be halted, and there will be a period of at least two days for RND to update the genesis file — either in the instance of errors, or if the community feels there needs to be a reallocation.\n', 'Only token holders will be eligible to vote on the allocation scheme. Any questions regarding discrepancies in personal allocations for testnet participants, contributors and Oracle founders via the private sale, or other contributors to the community process of launching Flash Oracle can be sent to accounting [at] Flash.Oracle.
