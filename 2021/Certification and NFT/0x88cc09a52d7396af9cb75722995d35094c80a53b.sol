Today we are here to introduce to the DeFi ecosystem, for the first time ever, a brand new mining system: Frequency Mining, a new term coined by the Horse Protocol team.\n', 'But before we talk about Frequency Mining, there are a few important changes that we’d like to address first. Even after the publication of HRS tokenomics article, the team did not stop thinking if there is an even fairer way of launching. Just earlier today, we indeed have come up with an EVEN FAIRER TOKEN DISTRIBUTION for Horse Protocol users. In our old token distribution model, 40% of the HRS tokens are given to LP mining and 40% are given to Frequency Mining (also known as deposit reward), however, this might not be the most ideal way of distributing HRS tokens since Frequency Mining allows users to earn HRS tokens with just ½ of the capital compared to LP mining. Therefore, we have changed the HRS token distribution to 20% LP mining and 60% Frequency Mining, giving users who have less funds better opportunities to earn HRS tokens(users can read the updated tokenomics article here). And this is not the only change we have made, in our previous model, the token emission is reduced by 20% every month. In the new model, this is still true for LP Mining, but different for Frequency Mining. For Frequency Mining, all of the first 1 billion USDT deposits get rewarded with a set standard, making the Frequency Mining as fair and transparent as possible. We will reward each 1k USDT deposit with 1.5 HRS; 10k USDT deposit with 6.75 HRS; and 100k USDT deposit with 60 HRS, adding up to a total of 600,000 HRS tokens. The Frequency Mining (deposit reward) ends when we hit the 1 billion USDT target, users will no longer get rewarded for their deposits after this. These changes are made with our best intention to make sure that everyone, no matter how much money they have, gets a level playing field in participating.\n', 'Because of these major improvements, we have to redeploy our contract. And because we have already introduced timelock in our contracts, it will take 24hr for this change to take place, we will have to delay our Frequency Mining (deposits reward) start time for a few hours. The deposit reward’s new starting time will be Friday (March 5th) 7pm EST.\n', '*Important update on March 10th, 2021: Per community suggested, Horse Protocol has decided to move to Frequency Mining v.2. Starting from March 15th, 2021 7pm EST, Horse Protocol will reduce the reward emission rate by 0.2% per 1 million increase in total volume. We strongly encourage readers to read the update here*\n', 'FREQUENCY MINING\n', '\n', "Users who have been involved with cryptocurrency for a while are probably familiar with the concept of following the whales' wallets. For those of you who don't know, this is when people observe the contract accounts of the ultra-wealthy individuals on block explorers like Bscscan or Etherscan, following their traces to see the tokens that they are purchasing, the protocols they are interacting with. With this feature, people can make their own investment decisions based on the whales' moves. This is like being able to peek inside Elon Musk or Bill Gates' bank accounts and investment portfolios in the CeFi world. Sounds good right? But imagine if people can do that to YOUR accounts too. Imagine being watched and traced every single move you are making on the block. Imagine what people with malicious intentions can do with all this information. The inability to send money to yourself without hundreds of thousands of people staring at you, feels like streaking. And in this case, while you are watching others, you are also being watched. This is the double-edge sword of being in DeFi. While one is in full control of his/her assets, he/she is also in full exposure of his/her assets allocations. But it does not have to be this way.\n", 'Horse Protocol, a non custodial and fully private transactions protocol, allows you to enjoy autonomy in the decentralized ecosystems without sacrificing your privacy in exchange. Unstreak yourself with us.\n', 'What is so unique about Horse Protocol?\n', "Some of you might wonder, well, isn't there already protocols available that are doing the same things? There's one crucial feature that sets Horse Protocol apart from its peers:\n", 'It is the first DeFi tokens private transactions protocol on Ethereum network\n', '\n', "Here is a list of tokens that will be included in phase 1 of Horse Protocol's private transactions list. We will kickoff with USDT as the first private transaction token, and add in other tokens to the private transactions program as we progress. If there are tokens with high interest that are not included in the list, HRS tokens holders will be able to vote on proposals to add new tokens to the list.\n", 'Crypto: BNB, ETH, BTCB\n', 'Stablecoins: USDT, BUSD, USDC, DAI\n', 'DeFi: CAKE, XVS, JULD, AUTO, BAKE, BUNNY, ACS\n', "Another key feature of Horse Protocol is its anonymity set liquidity incentive. As a private transactions protocol, the team understands the importance of having a large anonymity set- the larger the anonymity set, the harder it is for observers to tell which accounts and transactions belong to whom. HRS is able to achieve a large anonymity set by providing yield farming as incentives to attract more people to contribute to the liquidity of the anonymity set. Users can earn HRS tokens by staking any token from the tokens list mentioned above in the protocol's anonymity pools. With this incentive, people will be willing to contribute to the anonymity set and the larger the anonymity set, the more users it can attract, which further increases the size of the anonymity set, creating a positive cycle for the protocol.\n", 'How do we ensure transaction privacy in Horse Protocol?\n', "Horse Protocol achieves transaction privacy by using the zkSnarks proof, a type of cryptography that allows one party to prove the validity of another party's transactions without disclosing the identity of the senders or information unrelated to the validity of the transactions.\n", '*/\n', '\n', 'pragma solidity ^0.5.17;\n', 'interface IERC20 {\n', '    function totalSupply() external view returns(uint);\n', '\n', '    function balanceOf(address account)
