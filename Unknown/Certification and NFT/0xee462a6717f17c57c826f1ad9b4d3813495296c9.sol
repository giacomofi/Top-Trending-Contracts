You will own a % of the income of this dapp proportional to how much you deposited.\n', '// Ex: There is 98 Eth deposited, you deposit 2 Eth, new balance becomes 100 Eth, then you will own 2% of the profits!\n', '//\n', '//\n', '//\n', '// Dividends: Every deposit under 2 Eth is considered a dividend and is distributed between shareholders automatically. Even if the profit is bigger than 2 Eth, it will be distributed in 1-2 Ether packages, automatically.\n', '// Ex: We generate 100 Eth profit daily, then it will be distributed in 50 times in 2 ether packages, then those packages get shared between shareholders. With the example above if you hold 2%, then you will earn 50 times 0.04 Eth, which is 2 Eth profit in total.\n', '//\n', '//\n', "// Profit: This contract itself is not generating any profit, it's just a ledger to keep record of investors, and pays out dividends automatically.There will be other contracts linked to this, that will send the profits here. EthVentures is just the core of this business, there will be other contracts built on it.\n", '// Ex: A dice game built on this contract that generates say 10 Eth daily, will send the fees directly here\n', '// Ex: A doubler game built on this contract that generates 50 Eth daily, that will send all fees here\n', '// Ex: Any other form of contract that takes a % fee, and will send the fees directly here to be distributed between EthVentures shareholders.\n', '//\n', '//\n', '// How to invest: Just deposit minimum 2 Ether to the contract address, and you can see your total investments and % ownership in the Mist wallet if you follow this contract. You can deposit multiple times too, the total investments will add up if you send from the same address. The percentage ownership is calculated with a 10 billionth point precision, so you must divide that number by 100,000,000 to get the % ownership rate. Every other information, can be seen in the contract tab from your Mist Wallet, just make sure you are subscribed to this contract.\n', '//\n', '//\n', '//\n', '// Fees: There is a 1% deposit fee, and a 1% dividend payout fee that goes to the contract manager, everything else goes to investors!\n', '//\n', '//============================================================================================================================\n', '//\n', '// When EthVentures will be succesful, it will have tens or hundreds of different contracts, all sending the fees here to our investors, AUTOMATICALLY.
