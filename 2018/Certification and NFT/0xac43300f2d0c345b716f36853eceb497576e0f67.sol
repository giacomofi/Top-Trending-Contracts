This decreases code complexity and possible interactions between different parts of the code.\n', ' *  -We put a full bonus, free withdrawal period at the beginning.

Note that at this moment, no information can be taken for granted as parties can withdraw freely.\n', ' *  -Calling the fallback function while sending ETH places a bid with an infinite maximum valuation.
