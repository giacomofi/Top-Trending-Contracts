To see the most recent version of this text, visit:\n', '\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams\n', '\n', '\tDouglas Noel Adams (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English author, scriptwriter, essayist, humorist, satirist and dramatist. Adams was author\n', '\tof The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, which originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a "trilogy" of five books that sold\n', '\tmore than 15 million copies in his lifetime and generated a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005 a feature\n', '\tfilm. Adams&#39;s contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy&#39;s Hall of Fame. Adams also  wrote  Dirk  Gently&#39;s  Holistic  Detective\n', '\tAgency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), The Deeper  Meaning  of  Liff  (1990),  Last\n', '\tChance to See (1990), and three stories for the television series Doctor Who; he also served as script editor for the show&#39;s seventeenth season in\n', '\t1979. A posthumous collection of his works, including an unfinished novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002. Adams was an advocate for\n', '\tenvironmentalism  and  conservation,  a  lover  of  fast  cars,  technological  innovation  and  the  Apple  Macintosh,  and  a  radical  atheist.\n', '\n', '\tEarly life: Adams was born on 11 March 1952 to Janet (n&#233;e Donovan; 1927–2016) and Christopher Douglas Adams (1927–1985) in Cambridge, England. The\n', '\tFamily moved to the East End of London a few months after his birth, where his sister, Susan, was born three years later. His parents divorced  in\n', '\t1957;   Douglas,  Susan,  and  their  mother  moved  to  an  RSPCA  animal  shelter  in  Brentwood,  Essex,  run  by  his  maternal  grandparents.\n', '\n', '\tEducation: Adams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. At nine, he passed the entrance exam for  Brentwood  School,  an  independent\n', '\tschool whose alumni include Robin Day, Jack Straw, Noel Edmonds, and David Irving. Griff Rhys Jones was a year below him, and he was in  the  same\n', '\tclass as Stuckist artist Charles Thomson. He attended the prep school from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until  December 1970.  Adams  was  6\n', '\tfeet (1.8 m) by age 12 and stopped growing at 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m). His form master, Frank Halford, said his height had made him stand out and\n', '\tthat he had been self-conscious about it. His ability to write stories made him well known in the school. He became the only student  ever  to  be\n', '\tawarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative writing, something he remembered for the rest of his  life,  particularly  when  facing  writer&#39;s\n', '\tblock. Some of his earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on its photography club in The Brentwoodian in  1962,  or  spoof\n', '\treviews in the school magazine Broadsheet, edited by Paul Neil Milne Johnstone, who later became a character in  The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide.  He  also\n', '\tdesigned the cover of one issue of the Broadsheet, and had a letter and short story published in  The Eagle, the boys&#39;  comic,  in  1965.  A  poem\n', '\tentitled "A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining" written by Adams\n', '\tin January 1970, at the age of 17, was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early 2014. On the strength  of  a  bravura  essay  on  religious\n', '\tpoetry that discussed the Beatles and William Blake, he was awarded an Exhibition in English at St John&#39;s College, Cambridge, going up in 1971. He\n', '\twanted to join the Footlights, an invitation-only student comedy club that has  acted  as  a  hothouse  for  comic  talent.  He  was  not  elected\n', '\timmediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith,  forming  a  group  called\n', '\t"Adams-Smith-Adams", but became a member of the Footlights by 1973. Despite doing very little work—he recalled having completed  three  essays  in\n', '\tthree years—he graduated in 1974 with a B.A. in English literature.\n', '\n', '\tCareer: Writing: After leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV and radio as a writer. An edited version of  the\n', '\tFootlights Revue appeared on BBC2 television in 1974. A version of the Revue performed live in London&#39;s West End led to Adams being discovered  by\n', '\tMonty Python&#39;s Graham Chapman. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit in  episode 45  of  Monty Python  for  a\n', '\tsketch called "Patient Abuse". The pair also co-wrote the "Marilyn Monroe" sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of Monty Python  and  the\n', '\tHoly Grail. Adams is one of only two people other than the original Python members to get a writing credit (the other being Neil Innes). Adams had\n', '\ttwo brief appearances in the fourth series of Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus. At the beginning of episode 42,  "The Light Entertainment War",  Adams\n', '\tis in a surgeon&#39;s mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while  Michael  Palin  narrates  a  sketch  that\n', '\tintroduces one person after another but never gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, "Mr. Neutron", Adams is dressed in a pepper-pot outfit\n', '\tand loads a missile onto a cart driven by Terry Jones, who is calling for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The  two  episodes  were  broadcast  in\n', '\tNovember 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including Out of the Trees. At this point Adams&#39;s career stalled; his writing\n', '\tstyle was unsuited to the then-current style of radio and TV comedy. To make ends meet he took a series of  odd  jobs,  including  as  a  hospital\n', '\tporter, barn builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a Qatari family, who had made their fortune in oil. During  this\n', '\ttime Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his  career  had  a  brief  improvement  when  he  wrote  and\n', '\tperformed Unpleasantness at Brodie&#39;s Close at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved to\n', '\tlive with his mother. The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams&#39;s life; "I have terrible periods of  lack\n', '\tof confidence. I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can&#39;t fix the weather –\n', '\tyou just have to get on with it". Some of Adams&#39;s early radio work included sketches for The Burkiss Way in 1977 and The News Huddlines.  He  also\n', '\twrote, again with Chapman, the 20 February 1977 episode of Doctor on the Go, a sequel to the Doctor in the House television comedy  series.  After\n', '\tthe first radio series of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on Week Ending  and  a  pantomime\n', '\tcalled Black Cinderella Two Goes East. He left after six months to become the script editor for Doctor Who. In 1979  Adams  and  John Lloyd  wrote\n', '\tscripts for two half-hour episodes of Doctor Snuggles: "The Remarkable Fidgety River" and  "The Great Disappearing Mystery"  (episodes  eight  and\n', '\ttwelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original Hitchhiker radio series ("Fit the Fifth" and "Fit the Sixth", also  known\n', '\tas "Episode Five" and "Episode Six"), as well as The Meaning of Liff and The Deeper Meaning of Liff.\n', '\n', '\tThe Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy: The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy was a concept for a science-fiction  comedy  radio  series  pitched  by\n', '\tAdams and radio producer Simon Brett to BBC Radio 4 in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as  a  few  other  stories\n', '\t(reprinted in Neil Gaiman&#39;s book Don&#39;t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy Companion) that could be used in the series. According\n', '\tto Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a  copy\n', '\tof the Hitch-hiker&#39;s Guide to Europe, and it occurred to him that "somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy". He later said that\n', '\tthe constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event. Despite the original outline, Adams was said to  make  up\n', '\tthe stories as he wrote. He turned to John Lloyd for help with the final two episodes  of  the  first  series.  Lloyd  contributed  bits  from  an\n', '\tunpublished science fiction book of his own, called GiGax. Very little of Lloyd&#39;s material survived in later adaptations of Hitchhiker&#39;s, such  as\n', '\tthe novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely  re-written.\n', '\tBBC Radio 4 broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. The series was distributed in the United States by National\n', '\tPublic Radio. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly  known  as  the  Christmas\n', '\tEpisode. A second series of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21–25 January 1980. While working on  the  radio  series\n', '\t(and with simultaneous projects such as The Pirate Planet) Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that got worse  as  he  published\n', '\tnovels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in  a  hotel  suite\n', '\twith his editor for three weeks to ensure that So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish was completed. He was quoted as saying,  "I love deadlines.  I\n', '\tlove the whooshing noise they make as they go by." Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams wrote five novels  in  the  series,  published  in\n', '\t1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992. The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book  adaptations  for  each  of  the\n', '\tfirst three books, an interactive text-adventure computer game, and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a\n', '\t42 Puzzle designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four Hitchhiker&#39;s novels (the paperback for the fifth\n', '\tre-used the artwork from the hardback edition). In 1980 Adams began attempts to turn the first Hitchhiker&#39;s novel  into  a  film,  making  several\n', '\ttrips to Los Angeles, and working with Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio series  became  the  basis  for  a  BBC\n', '\ttelevision mini-series broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started  with\n', '\tDisney, which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay got a posthumous re-write by Karey Kirkpatrick, and the resulting film was released in\n', '\t2005. Radio producer Dirk Maggs had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based  on\n', '\tthe third novel in the Hitchhiker&#39;s series. They also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels  in  the  five-book\n', '\t"trilogy". As with the movie, this project was realised only after Adams&#39;s death. The third series, The Tertiary Phase, was broadcast on BBC Radio\n', '\t4 in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of Life, the Universe and Everything and\n', '\tediting, Adams can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless made up the  fourth\n', '\tand fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled The Quandary Phase and The Quintessential Phase) and these were broadcast  in  May\n', '\tand June 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, "more upbeat" ending) concluded  with,\n', '\t"The very final episode of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author."\n', '\n', '\tDirk Gently series: Between Adams&#39;s first trip to Madagascar with Mark Carwardine in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the  basis  for\n', '\tthe radio series and non-fiction book Last Chance to See, Adams wrote two other novels  with  a  new  cast  of  characters. Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic\n', '\tDetective Agency was published in 1987, and was described by  its  author  as  "a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic,\n', '\tmainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics". It was derived from two Doctor Who serials Adams had  written.  A  sequel,  The Long Dark\n', '\tTea-Time of the Soul, was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams&#39;s  first  since  So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.\n', '\tAfter  the  book  tour,  Adams  set  off  on  his  round-the-world  excursion  which  supplied  him  with  the  material  for  Last Chance to See.\n', '\n', '\tDoctor Who: Adams sent the script for the HHGG pilot radio programme to the Doctor Who production office in 1978, and was  commissioned  to  write\n', '\tThe Pirate Planet (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen",  which\n', '\tlater became his novel Life, the Universe and Everything (which in turn became the third Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide radio series). Adams then went  on  to\n', '\tserve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three Doctor Who serials  starring  Tom Baker  as  the\n', '\tDoctor: "The Pirate Planet" (the second serial in the "Key to Time" arc, in season 16) "City of Death" (with  producer  Graham Williams,  from  an\n', '\toriginal storyline by writer David Fisher. It was transmitted under the pseudonym "David Agnew") "Shada" (only partially filmed; not televised due\n', '\tto industry disputes) The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that were not novelised as Adams would not allow  anyone  else  to  write\n', '\tthem, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay. "Shada" was later adapted as a novel by  Gareth Roberts  in  2012  and\n', '\t"City of Death" and "The Pirate Planet" by James Goss in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Elements of Shada and City of Death were  reused  in  Adams&#39;s\n', '\tlater novel Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic Detective Agency, in particular the character of Professor Chronotis. Big Finish Productions eventually  remade\n', '\tShada as an audio play starring Paul McGann as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was webcast on the BBC  website  in\n', '\t2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on  the  digital  radio  station\n', '\tBBC7 on 10 December 2005. In the Doctor Who 2012 Christmas episode The Snowmen, writer Steven Moffat  was  inspired  by  a  storyline  that  Adams\n', '\tpitched called The Doctor Retires.\n', '\n', '\tMusic: Adams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died (having received his first  guitar\n', '\tin 1964). He also studied piano in the 1960s with the same teacher as Paul Wickens, the pianist who plays in Paul McCartney&#39;s band  (and  composed\n', '\tthe music for the 2004–2005 editions of the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide radio series). Pink Floyd and Procol Harum had important influence on Adams&#39;  work.\n', '\n', '\tPink Floyd: Adams&#39;s official biography shares its name with the song  "Wish You Were Here"  by  Pink Floyd.  Adams  was  friends  with  Pink Floyd\n', '\tguitarist David Gilmour and, on Adams&#39;s 42nd birthday, he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd&#39;s concert of  28  October  1994  at\n', '\tEarls Court in London, playing guitar on the songs "Brain Damage" and "Eclipse". Adams chose the name  for  Pink Floyd&#39;s 1994 album,  The Division\n', '\tBell, by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, "High Hopes". Gilmour also performed at Adams&#39;s memorial  service  in  2001,  and\n', '\twhat would have been Adams&#39;s 60th birthday party in 2012.\n', '\t\n', '\tComputer games and projects: Douglas Adams created an interactive fiction version of HHGG with Steve Meretzky from Infocom in  1984.  In  1986  he\n', '\tparticipated in a week-long brainstorming session with the Lucasfilm Games team for the game Labyrinth. Later he was  also  involved  in  creating\n', '\tBureaucracy as a parody of events in his own life. Adams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of The Digital Village, a  digital  media  and\n', '\tInternet company with which he created Starship Titanic, a Codie Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated adventure game, which was published in 1998  by\n', '\tSimon & Schuster. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled Douglas Adams&#39; Starship Titanic, since Adams was too busy  with  the  computer\n', '\tgame to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the H2G2 collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at  making  The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide\n', '\tto the Galaxy a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from 2001 to 2011.  In\n', '\t1990, Adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme Hyperland which featured  Tom Baker  as  a  "software agent"  (similar  to  the\n', '\tassistant pictured in Apple&#39;s Knowledge Navigator video of future concepts  from  1987),  and  interviews  with  Ted Nelson,  the  co-inventor  of\n', '\thypertext and the person who coined the term. Adams was an early adopter and advocate of hypertext.\n', '\n', '\tPersonal beliefs and activism: Atheism and views on religion: Adams described himself as a "radical atheist", adding "radical" for emphasis so  he\n', '\twould not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it.  He  imagined  a  sentient\n', '\tpuddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, "This is an interesting world I find myself in – an interesting hole I find myself in – fits me rather\n', '\tneatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" to  demonstrate  his  view  that  the  fine-tuned\n', '\tUniverse argument for God was a fallacy. He remained fascinated by religion because of its effect  on  human  affairs.  "I love to keep poking and\n', '\tprodding at it. I&#39;ve thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill  over  into  my  writing."  The  evolutionary\n', '\tbiologist and atheist Richard Dawkins uses Adams&#39;s influence to exemplify arguments for non-belief in  his  2006  book  The God Delusion.  Dawkins\n', '\tdedicated the book to Adams, whom he jokingly called "possibly [my] only convert" to atheism and  wrote  on  his  death  that  "Science has lost a\n', '\tfriend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender."\n', '\n', '\tEnvironmental activism: Adams was also an environmental activist who campaigned on behalf  of  endangered  species.  This  activism  included  the\n', '\tproduction of the non-fiction radio series Last Chance to See, in which he and naturalist Mark Carwardine visited rare species such as the  kakapo\n', '\tand baiji, and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992 this was made into a CD-ROM combination of audiobook, e-book and picture\n', '\tslide show. Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the &#39;Meeting a Gorilla&#39; passage from Last Chance to See to the book The Great Ape Project.  This\n', '\tbook, edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for  the  extension  of  moral  equality  to\n', '\tinclude all great apes, human and non-human. In 1994, he participated in a climb of Mount Kilimanjaro while wearing a rhino suit for  the  British\n', '\tcharity organisation Save the Rhino International. Puppeteer William Todd-Jones, who had originally worn the suit in the London Marathon to  raise\n', '\tmoney and bring awareness to the group, also participated in the climb wearing a rhino suit; Adams wore the suit while travelling to the  mountain\n', '\tbefore the climb began. About &#163;100,000 was raised through that event, benefiting schools in Kenya and a black rhinoceros preservation programme in\n', '\tTanzania. Adams was also an active supporter of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Since 2003, Save the Rhino has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial\n', '\tLecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.\n', '\n', '\tTechnology and innovation: Adams bought his first word processor in 1982, having considered one as early as 1979. His first purchase was  a  Nexu.\n', '\tIn 1983, when he and Jane Belson went to Los Angeles, he bought a DEC Rainbow. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an Apricot, then  a  BBC\n', '\tMicro and a Tandy 1000. In Last Chance to See Adams mentions his Cambridge Z88, which he had taken to Zaire on a quest to find the northern  white\n', '\trhinoceros. Adams&#39;s posthumously published work, The Salmon of Doubt, features several articles by him on the  subject  of  technology,  including\n', '\treprints of articles that originally ran in MacUser magazine, and in The Independent on Sunday newspaper. In these Adams claims that  one  of  the\n', '\tfirst computers he ever saw was a Commodore PET, and that he had "adored" his Apple Macintosh ("or rather my family of however many Macintoshes it\n', '\tis that I&#39;ve recklessly accumulated over the years") since he first saw one at Infocom&#39;s offices in Boston in 1984. Adams  was  a  Macintosh  user\n', '\tfrom the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in Europe (the  second  being  Stephen Fry\n', '\t– though some accounts differ on this, saying Fry bought his Mac first. Fry claims he was second to Adams).  Adams  was  also  an  "Apple Master",\n', '\tcelebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (others included John Cleese and Gregory Hines). Adams&#39;s contributions  included  a\n', '\trock video that he created using the first version of iMovie with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video was available  on  Adams&#39;s  .Mac\n', '\thomepage. Adams installed and started using the first release of Mac OS X in the weeks leading up to his death. His very  last  post  to  his  own\n', '\tforum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its Cocoa programming framework. He said it was "awesome...", which  was  also  the  last\n', '\tword he wrote on his site. Adams used email to correspond with Steve Meretzky in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom&#39;s  version\n', '\tof The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his  own  USENET\n', '\tnewsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy. Challenges to the authenticity\n', '\tof his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams  was  a  keynote  speaker  at  the\n', '\tMicrosoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his  keynote\n', '\tspeech is archived on Channel 9. Adams was also a keynote speaker for the April 2001 Embedded Systems Conference  in  San Francisco,  one  of  the\n', '\tmajor technical conferences on embedded system engineering.\n', '\n', '\tPersonal life: Adams moved to Upper Street, Islington, in 1981 and to Duncan Terrace, a few minutes&#39; walk away, in the late 1980s.  In  the  early\n', '\t1980s Adams had an affair with novelist Sally Emerson, who was separated from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his  book  Life, the\n', '\tUniverse and Everything to Emerson. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, Peter Stothard, a contemporary of Adams&#39;s  at  Brentwood School,  and\n', '\tlater editor of The Times. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved.  Belson  was  the\n', '\t"lady barrister" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [Adams] lives  in  Islington  with  a  lady\n', '\tbarrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on  an  early  screenplay  adaptation  of\n', '\tHitchhiker&#39;s. When the deal fell through, they moved back to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where  he  lives,\n', '\tor with whom") and a broken engagement, they married on 25 November 1991. Adams and Belson had  one  daughter  together,  Polly Jane Rocket Adams,\n', '\tborn on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999 the family moved from London to Santa Barbara, California, where they lived until his\n', '\tdeath. Following the  funeral,  Jane Belson  and  Polly Adams  returned  to  London.  Belson  died  on  7  September  2011  of  cancer,  aged  59.\n', '\n', '\tDeath and legacy: Adams died of a heart attack on 11 May 2001, aged 49, after resting from his regular workout at  a  private  gym  in  Montecito,\n', '\tCalifornia. Adams had been due to deliver the commencement address at Harvey Mudd College on 13 May. His funeral was  held  on  16  May  in  Santa\n', '\tBarbara. His ashes were placed in Highgate Cemetery in  north  London  in  June  2002.  A  memorial  service  was  held  on  17 September 2001  at\n', '\tSt Martin-in-the-Fields church, Trafalgar Square, London. This became the first church service broadcast live on the web by the  BBC.  Video clips\n', '\tof the service are still available on the BBC&#39;s website for download. One of his last public appearances was a talk given  at  the  University  of\n', '\tCalifornia, Santa Barbara, Parrots, the universe and everything, recorded days before his death. A full transcript of the talk is  available,  and\n', '\tthe university has made the full video available on YouTube. Two days before Adams died, the Minor Planet Center announced the naming of  asteroid\n', '\t18610 Arthurdent. In 2005, the asteroid 25924 Douglasadams was named in his memory. In May 2002,  The Salmon of Doubt  was  published,  containing\n', '\tmany short stories, essays, and letters, as well as eulogies from Richard Dawkins, Stephen Fry (in the UK edition), Christopher Cerf  (in  the  US\n', '\tedition), and Terry Jones (in the US paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his unfinished novel, The Salmon of Doubt, which  was\n', '\toriginally intended to become a new Dirk Gently novel, but might have later become the sixth Hitchhiker novel. Other events  after  Adams&#39;s  death\n', '\tincluded a webcast production of Shada, allowing the complete story to be told, radio dramatisations of the final three books in the  Hitchhiker&#39;s\n', '\tseries, and the completion of the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. The film, released in 2005, posthumously credits  Adams\n', '\tas a producer, and several design elements – including a head-shaped planet seen near the end of the  film  –  incorporated  Adams&#39;s  features.  A\n', '\t12-part radio series based on the Dirk Gently novels was announced in 2007. BBC Radio 4 also commissioned a third Dirk Gently radio  series  based\n', '\ton the incomplete chapters of The Salmon of Doubt, and written by Kim Fuller; but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on  the  two\n', '\tcompleted novels. A sixth Hitchhiker novel, And Another Thing..., by Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer, was released on 12 October  2009  (the  30th\n', '\tanniversary of the first book), published with the support of Adams&#39;s estate. A BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime adaptation  and  an  audio  book  soon\n', '\tfollowed. On 25 May 2001, two weeks after Adams&#39;s death, his fans organised a tribute known as Towel Day, which has been observed every year since\n', '\tthen. In 2011, over 3,000 people took part in a public vote to choose the subjects of People&#39;s Plaques in Islington; Adams received 489 votes.  On\n', '\t11 March 2013, Adams&#39;s 61st birthday was celebrated with an interactive Google Doodle. In 2018, John Lloyd presented an hour-long episode  of  the\n', '\tBBC Radio Four documentary Archive on 4, discussing Adams&#39; private papers,  which  are  held  at  St John&#39;s College,  Cambridge.  The  episode  is\n', '\tavailable online. A street in S&#227;o Jos&#233;, Santa Catarina, Brazil is named in Adams&#39; honour.\n', '\n', '\tThe following text has been lifted from WikiPedia on 14 June 2018. To see the most recent version of this text, visit:\n', '\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy\n', '\tThe Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy (sometimes referred to as HG2G, HHGTTG or H2G2 is a comedy science fiction series created  by  Douglas Adams.\n', '\tOriginally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, it was later adapted to other formats, including stage shows, novels,  comic books,  a\n', '\t1981 TV series, a 1984 video game, and 2005 feature film. A prominent series in British popular culture, The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy  has\n', '\tbecome an international multi-media phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages  by\n', '\t2005. In 2017, BBC Radio 4 announced a 40th-anniversary celebration with Dirk Maggs, one of the original producers, in charge. This  sixth  series\n', '\tof the sci-fi spoof has been based on Eoin Colfer&#39;s book And Another Thing, with additional unpublished material by Douglas Adams.  The  first  of\n', '\tsix new episodes was broadcast on 8 March 2018. The broad narrative of Hitchhiker follows the misadventures of  the  last  surviving  man,  Arthur\n', '\tDent, following the demolition of the planet Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued from  Earth&#39;s\n', '\tdestruction by Ford Prefect, a human-like  alien  writer  for  the  eccentric,  electronic travel guide  The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy,  by\n', '\thitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft. Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters  Trillian,  another  human\n', '\tthat had been taken from Earth prior to its destruction by the  President of the Galaxy,  the  two-headed  Zaphod Beeblebrox,  and  the  depressed\n', '\tMarvin, the Paranoid Android. Certain narrative details were changed between the various adaptations.\n', '\n', '\tPlot: The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially\n', '\tfor each new adaptation. Throughout all versions, the  series  follows  the  adventures  of  Arthur Dent,  a  hapless  Englishman,  following  the\n', '\tdestruction of the Earth by the Vogons, a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens, to make way for an intergalactic bypass.  Dent&#39;s  adventures\n', '\tintersect with several other characters: Ford Prefect (who named himself after the Ford Prefect car to blend in with what was assumed  to  be  the\n', '\tdominant life form, automobiles), an alien from a small planet somewhere in the  vicinity  of  Betelgeuse  and  a  researcher  for  the  eponymous\n', '\tguidebook, who rescues Dent from Earth&#39;s destruction; Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford&#39;s eccentric semi-cousin and the  Galactic President;  the  depressed\n', '\trobot Marvin the Paranoid Android; and Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and  the  only\n', '\tother human survivor of Earth&#39;s destruction thanks to Beeblebrox&#39; intervention.\n', '\n', '\tBackground: The first radio series comes from a proposal called "The Ends of the Earth": six self-contained  episodes,  all  ending  with  Earth&#39;s\n', '\tbeing destroyed in a different way. While writing the first episode, Adams realized that he needed someone on the  planet  who  was  an  alien  to\n', '\tprovide some context, and that this alien needed a reason to be there. Adams finally settled on  making  the  alien  a  roving  researcher  for  a\n', '\t"wholly remarkable book" named The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. As the first radio episode&#39;s writing progressed, the Guide became the  centre\n', '\tof his story, and he decided to focus the series on it, with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over. Adams claimed that the title  came\n', '\tfrom a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of  the  Hitch-hiker&#39;s Guide to Europe  book:  while  lying\n', '\tdrunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars, he thought it would be a good idea for  someone  to  write  a\n', '\thitchhiker&#39;s guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten  the  incident\n', '\titself, and only remembered himself telling the story. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of "hitch-hiking around  the\n', '\tgalaxy" to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973. Adams&#39;s fictional Guide  is  an  electronic  guidebook  to  the  entire  universe,  originally\n', '\tpublished by Megadodo Publications, one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta. The narrative of the various versions of the story  are\n', '\tfrequently punctuated with excerpts from the Guide. The voice of the Guide (Peter Jones in the first two  radio  series  and  TV  versions,  later\n', '\tWilliam Franklyn in the third, fourth and  fifth  radio  series,  and  Stephen Fry  in  the  movie  version),  also  provides  general  narration.\n', '\n', '\tOriginal radio series: The first radio series of six episodes (called "Fits" after the names of the sections of Lewis Carroll&#39;s nonsense poem "The\n', '\tHunting of the Snark") was broadcast in 1978 on BBC Radio 4. Despite a low-key launch of the series (the first episode was broadcast  at  10:30 pm\n', '\ton Wednesday, 8 March 1978), it received generally good reviews and a tremendous audience reaction for radio.  A  one-off  episode  (a  "Christmas\n', '\tspecial") was broadcast later in the year. The BBC had a practice at the time of commissioning  "Christmas Special"  episodes  for  popular  radio\n', '\tseries, and while an early draft of this episode of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide had a Christmas-related plotline, it was  decided  to  be  "in slightly\n', '\tpoor taste" and the episode as transmitted served as a bridge between the two series. This episode was released as part of the second radio series\n', '\tand, later, The Secondary Phase on cassettes and CDs. The Primary and Secondary Phases were aired, in a slightly edited  version,  in  the  United\n', '\tStates on NPR Playhouse. The first series was repeated twice in 1978 alone and many more  times  in  the  next  few  years.  This  led  to  an  LP\n', '\tre-recording, produced independently of the BBC for sale, and a further adaptation of the series as a book. A second radio series, which consisted\n', '\tof a further six episodes, and bringing the total number of episodes to 12, was broadcast in 1980. The radio  series  (and the LP and TV versions)\n', '\tgreatly benefited from the narration of noted comedy actor Peter Jones as The Book. He was cast after it was decided that a "Peter Jonesy" sort of\n', '\tvoice was required. This led to a three-month search for an actor who sounded exactly like Peter Jones, which was unsuccessful. The producers then\n', '\thired Peter Jones as exactly the "Peter Jonesy" voice they were looking for. The series was also notable for its use of  sound,  being  the  first\n', '\tcomedy series to be produced in stereo. Adams said that he wanted the programme&#39;s production to be comparable to that of a modern rock album. Much\n', '\tof the programme&#39;s budget was spent on sound effects, which were largely the work of Paddy Kingsland (for  the  pilot  episode  and  the  complete\n', '\tsecond series) at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and Dick Mills and Harry Parker (for the remaining  episodes (2–6) of the first series).  The  fact\n', '\tthat they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of Hitchhiker&#39;s became some of\n', '\tthe first radio shows to be mixed into four-channel Dolby Surround. This mix was also featured on DVD releases of  the  third  radio  series.  The\n', '\ttheme tune used for the radio, television, LP and film versions is "Journey of the Sorcerer", an instrumental piece composed by Bernie Leadon  and\n', '\trecorded by The Eagles on their album One of These Nights. Only the transmitted radio series used the original recording; a sound-alike  cover  by\n', '\tTim Souster was used for the LP and TV series, another arrangement by Joby Talbot was used for the 2005 film, and still another arrangement,  this\n', '\ttime by Philip Pope, was recorded to be released with the CDs of the  last  three  radio  series.  Apparently,  Adams  chose  this  song  for  its\n', '\tfuturistic-sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it, which, as Geoffrey Perkins recalls, Adams said would give an  "on the\n', '\troad, hitch-hiking feel" to it. The twelve episodes were released (in a slightly edited form, removing the Pink Floyd music and  two  other  tunes\n', '\t"hummed" by Marvin when the team land on Magrathea) on CD and cassette in 1988, becoming the first CD release in  the  BBC Radio Collection.  They\n', '\twere re-released in 1992, and at this time Adams suggested that they could retitle Fits the First to Sixth  as  "The Primary Phase"  and  Fits the\n', '\tSeventh to Twelfth as "The Secondary Phase" instead of just "the first series" and "the second series". It was at about this time that a "Tertiary\n', '\tPhase" was first discussed with Dirk Maggs, adapting Life, the Universe and Everything, but this series would not  be  recorded  for  another  ten\n', '\tyears. Main cast:\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tSimon Jones as Arthur Dent\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tGeoffrey McGivern as Ford Prefect\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tSusan Sheridan as Trillian\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Wing-Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tStephen Moore as Marvin, the Paranoid Android\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tRichard Vernon as Slartibartfast\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tPeter Jones as The Book\n', '\n', '\tNovels: The novels are described as "a trilogy in five parts", having been described as a trilogy on the release of the  third book,  and  then  a\n', '\t"trilogy in four parts" on the release of the fourth book. The US edition of the fifth book was originally released  with  the  legend  "The fifth\n', '\tbook in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker&#39;s Trilogy" on the cover. Subsequent re-releases of the other novels bore  the  legend  "The\n', '\t[first, second, third, fourth] book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker&#39;s Trilogy".  In  addition,  the  blurb  on  the  fifth  book\n', '\tdescribes it as "the book that gives a whole new meaning to the word &#39;trilogy&#39;". The plots of the television and radio series are more or less the\n', '\tsame as that of the first two novels, though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed. Much of parts five\n', '\tand six of the radio series were written by John Lloyd, but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not  included\n', '\there. Many consider the books&#39; version of events to be definitive because they are the most readily accessible and widely distributed  version  of\n', '\tthe story. However, they are not the final version that Adams produced. Before his death from a heart attack on 11 May 2001, Adams was considering\n', '\twriting a sixth novel in the Hitchhiker&#39;s series. He was working on a third Dirk Gently novel, under the  working  title  The Salmon of Doubt, but\n', '\tfelt that the book was not working and abandoned it. In an interview, he said some of the ideas in the book might fit better  in  the Hitchhiker&#39;s\n', '\tseries, and suggested he might rework those ideas into a sixth book in that series. He described Mostly Harmless as "a very bleak book"  and  said\n', '\the "would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note". Adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth instalment, he would  at\n', '\tleast start with all the characters in the same place. Eoin Colfer, who wrote the sixth book in the Hitchhiker&#39;s  series  in  2008–09,  used  this\n', '\tlatter concept but none of the plot ideas from The Salmon of Doubt.\n', '\t\n', '\tThe Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy: In The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy (published in 1979),  the  characters  visit  the  legendary  planet\n', '\tMagrathea, home to the now-collapsed planet-building industry, and meet Slartibartfast, a planetary coastline designer who was responsible for the\n', '\tfjords of Norway. Through archival recordings, he relates the story of a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings  who  built  a  computer\n', '\tnamed Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. When the answer was revealed to be  42,\n', '\tDeep Thought explained that the answer was incomprehensible because the beings didn&#39;t know what they were asking.  It  went  on  to  predict  that\n', '\tanother computer, more powerful than itself would be made and designed by it to calculate the question for  the  answer.  (Later  on,  referencing\n', '\tthis, Adams would  create  the 42 Puzzle, a puzzle which could be approached in multiple ways, all yielding the answer 42.)  The  computer,  often\n', '\tmistaken for a planet (because of its size and use of biological components), was the Earth, and was  destroyed  by  Vogons  to  make  way  for  a\n', '\thyperspatial express route five minutes before the conclusion of its 10-million-year  program.  Two  members  of  the  race  of  hyper-intelligent\n', '\tpan-dimensional beings who commissioned the Earth in the first place disguise themselves as Trillian&#39;s mice, and want to dissect Arthur&#39;s brain to\n', '\thelp reconstruct the question, since he was part of the Earth&#39;s matrix moments before it was destroyed, and so he is likely to have  part  of  the\n', '\tquestion buried in his brain. Trillian is also human but had left Earth six months previously with Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy. The\n', '\tprotagonists escape, setting the course for "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe". The mice, in Arthur&#39;s absence, create  a  phony  question\n', '\tsince it is too troublesome for them to wait 10 million years again just to cash in on a lucrative deal. The book was adapted from the first  four\n', '\tradio episodes. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by Pan Books, after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing\n', '\ta novelization, an action they would later regret. The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold  over  250,000\n', '\tcopies within three months of its release. A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books, a division of Random House in the  United States  in\n', '\tOctober 1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the magazine Rolling Stone to build word  of\n', '\tmouth. In 2005, Del Rey Books rereleased the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie. To date, it  has  sold  over  14\n', '\tmillion copies. A photo-illustrated edition of the first novel appeared in 1994.\n', '\t\n', '\tThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe: In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (published in 1980), Zaphod is separated from  the  others\n', '\tand finds he is part of a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets Zarniwoop, a conspirator and editor for The Guide,  who\n', '\tknows where to find the secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways, the restaurant of the title. Zaphod\n', '\tand Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which turns out to be a stunt ship pre-programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage\n', '\tshow. Unable to change course, the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than  having  no\n', '\tautomatic control (someone must remain behind to operate it), and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself.  Zaphod  and  Trillian  discover  that  the\n', '\tUniverse is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat. Ford and Arthur, meanwhile, end  up  on  a\n', '\tspacecraft full of the outcasts of the Golgafrinchan civilization. The ship crashes on prehistoric Earth; Ford and Arthur  are  stranded,  and  it\n', '\tbecomes clear that the inept Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans,  having  displaced  the  Earth&#39;s  indigenous  hominids.  This  has\n', '\tdisrupted the Earth&#39;s programming so that when Ford and Arthur manage to extract the final readout from  Arthur&#39;s  subconscious  mind  by  pulling\n', '\tlettered tiles from a Scrabble set, it is "What do you get if you multiply six by nine?"  Arthur  then  comments,  "I&#39;ve  always  said  there  was\n', '\tsomething fundamentally wrong with the universe." The book was adapted from the remaining material in the radio  series—covering  from  the  fifth\n', '\tepisode to the twelfth episode, although the ordering was greatly changed (in particular, the events of Fit the Sixth, with Ford and Arthur  being\n', '\tstranded on pre-historic Earth, end the book, and their rescue in Fit the Seventh is deleted), and most of the Brontitall  incident  was  omitted,\n', '\tinstead of the Haggunenon sequence, co-written by John Loyd, the Disaster Area stunt ship was substituted—this having first been introduced in the\n', '\tLP version. Adams himself considered Restaurant to be his best novel of the five.\n', '\t\n', '\tLife, the Universe and Everything: In Life, the Universe and Everything  (published in 1982),  Ford  and  Arthur  travel  through  the  space-time\n', '\tcontinuum from prehistoric Earth to Lord&#39;s Cricket Ground. There they run into Slartibartfast, who enlists their aid in preventing  galactic  war.\n', '\tLong ago, the people of Krikkit attempted to wipe out all life in the Universe, but they were stopped and imprisoned on  their  home  planet;  now\n', '\tthey are poised to escape. With the help of Marvin, Zaphod, and Trillian, our heroes prevent the destruction of life in the Universe and go  their\n', '\tseparate ways. This was the first Hitchhiker&#39;s book originally written as a book and not adapted from radio. Its story was based  on  a  treatment\n', '\tAdams had written for a Doctor Who theatrical release, with the Doctor role being split between Slartibartfast (to begin with), and later Trillian\n', '\tand Arthur. In 2004 it was adapted for radio as the Tertiary Phase of the radio series.\n', '\t\n', '\tSo Long, and Thanks for All  the  Fish: In So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish  (published  in  1984),  Arthur  returns  home  to  Earth,  rather\n', '\tsurprisingly since it was destroyed when he left. He meets and falls in love  with  a  girl  named  Fenchurch,  and  discovers  this  Earth  is  a\n', '\treplacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually, he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in  the\n', '\tmeantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God&#39;s Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android,\n', '\twho, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read  the\n', '\tmessage and feel better about it all before expiring. This was the first Hitchhiker&#39;s novel which was not an adaptation of any previously  written\n', '\tstory or script. In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quandary Phase of the radio series.\n', '\n', '\tMostly Harmless: Finally, in Mostly Harmless  (published  in  1992),  Vogons  take  over  The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide  (under  the  name  of  InfiniDim\n', '\tEnterprises), to finish, once and for all, the task of obliterating the Earth. After abruptly losing Fenchurch and  traveling  around  the  galaxy\n', '\tdespondently, Arthur&#39;s spaceship crashes on the planet Lamuella, where he settles in happily as the official sandwich-maker for a small village of\n', '\tsimple, peaceful people. Meanwhile, Ford Prefect breaks into The Guide&#39;s offices, gets himself an  infinite  expense  account  from  the  computer\n', '\tsystem, and then meets The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, Mark II, an artificially intelligent, multi-dimensional guide with vast  power  and a\n', '\thidden purpose. After he declines this dangerously powerful machine&#39;s aid (which he receives anyway), he sends it to Arthur Dent for  safety  ("Oh\n', '\tyes, whose?"—Arthur). Trillian uses DNA that Arthur donated for traveling money to have a daughter, and when she goes to cover a war,  she  leaves\n', '\ther daughter Random Frequent Flyer Dent with Arthur. Random, a more than typically troubled teenager, steals The Guide Mark II and uses it to  get\n', '\tto Earth. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Tricia McMillan (Trillian in this alternate universe) follow her to  a  crowded  club,  where  an  anguished\n', '\tRandom becomes startled by a noise and inadvertently fires her gun at Arthur. The shot  misses  Arthur  and  kills  a  man  (the  ever-unfortunate\n', '\tAgrajag). Immediately afterwards, The Guide Mark II causes the removal of all possible Earths from probability. All of the main  characters,  save\n', '\tZaphod, were on Earth at the time and are apparently killed, bringing a good deal of satisfaction to the Vogons. In 2005 it was adapted for  radio\n', '\tas the Quintessential Phase of the radio series, with the final episode first transmitted on 21 June 2005.\n', '\t\n', '\tAnd Another Thing...: It was announced in September 2008 that Eoin Colfer, author of Artemis Fowl,  had  been  commissioned  to  write  the  sixth\n', '\tinstalment entitled And Another Thing... with the support of Jane Belson, Adams&#39;s widow. The book was published by Penguin Books  in  the  UK  and\n', '\tHyperion in the US in October 2009. The story begins as death rays bear down on Earth, and the characters awaken from a  virtual  reality.  Zaphod\n', '\tpicks them up shortly before they are killed, but completely fails to escape the death beams. They  are  then  saved  by  Bowerick Wowbagger,  the\n', '\tInfinitely Prolonged, whom they agree to help kill. Zaphod travels to Asgard to get Thor&#39;s help. In  the  meantime,  the  Vogons  are  heading  to\n', '\tdestroy a colony of people who also escaped Earth&#39;s destruction, on the planet Nano. Arthur, Wowbagger, Trillian and Random head to Nano to try to\n', '\tstop the Vogons, and on the journey, Wowbagger and Trillian fall in love, making Wowbagger  question  whether  or  not  he  wants  to  be  killed.\n', '\tZaphod arrives with Thor, who then signs up to be the planet&#39;s God. With Random&#39;s help, Thor almost kills Wowbagger. Wowbagger, who  merely  loses\n', '\this immortality, then marries Trillian. Thor then stops the first Vogon attack and apparently dies. Meanwhile, Constant Mown,  son  of  Prostetnic\n', '\tJeltz, convinces his father that the people on the planet are not citizens of Earth, but are, in fact, citizens of Nano, which means that it would\n', '\tbe illegal to kill them. As the book draws to a close, Arthur is on his way to check  out  a  possible  university  for  Random,  when,  during  a\n', '\thyperspace jump, he is flung across alternate universes, has a brief encounter with Fenchurch, and ends up exactly where  he  would  want  to  be.\n', '\tAnd then the Vogons turn up again. In 2017 it was adapted for radio as the Hexagonal Phase of the radio series, with its  premiere  episode  first\n', '\ttransmitted on 8 March 2018, (exactly forty years, to the day, from the first episode of the first series, the Primary Phase).\n', '\n', '\tOmnibus editions: Two omnibus editions were created by Douglas Adams to combine the Hitchhiker series novels and to "set the record straight". The\n', '\tstories came in so many different formats that Adams stated that every time he told it he would contradict himself. Therefore, he  stated  in  the\n', '\tintroduction of The More Than Complete Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide that  "anything I put down wrong here is, as far as I&#39;m concerned, wrong for good."  The\n', '\ttwo omnibus editions were  The More Than Complete Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, Complete and Unabridged  (published in 1987)  and  The Ultimate Hitchhiker&#39;s\n', '\tGuide, Complete and Unabridged (published in 1997).\n', '\tThe More Than Complete Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide: Published in 1987, this 624-page leatherbound omnibus edition contains "wrong for good" versions of the\n', '\tfour Hitchhiker series novels at the time, and also includes one short story:\n', '\t\tThe Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy\n', '\t\tThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe\n', '\t\tLife, the Universe and Everything\n', '\t\tSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\n', '\t\t"Young Zaphod Plays it Safe"\n', '\tThe Ultimate Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide: Published in 1997, this 832-page leatherbound final omnibus edition contains five Hitchhiker  series  novels  and\n', '\tone short story:\n', '\t\tThe Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy\n', '\t\tThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe\n', '\t\tLife, the Universe and Everything\n', '\t\tSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\n', '\t\tMostly Harmless\n', '\t\t"Young Zaphod Plays it Safe"\n', '\tAlso appearing in The Ultimate Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, at the end of Adams&#39;s introduction, is a list  of  instructions  on  "How to Leave the Planet",\n', '\tproviding a humorous explanation of how one might replicate Arthur and Ford&#39;s feat at the beginning of Hitchhiker&#39;s.\n', '\n', '\tOther Hitchhiker&#39;s-related books and stories:\n', '\t\tRelated stories:\n', '\t\t\tA short story by Adams, "Young Zaphod Plays It Safe", first appeared in The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book,  a  special\n', '\t\t\tlarge-print compilation of different stories and pictures that raised money for the then-new Comic Relief charity in  the  UK.  The  story\n', '\t\t\talso appears in some of the omnibus editions of the trilogy, and in The Salmon of Doubt. There are two \tversions of  this  story,  one  of\n', '\t\t\twhich is slightly more explicit in its political commentary.\n', '\n', '\t\t\tA novel, Douglas Adams&#39; Starship Titanic: A Novel, written by Terry Jones, is based on Adams&#39;s computer game of  the  same  name,  Douglas\n', '\t\t\tAdams&#39;s Starship Titanic, which in turn is based on an idea from Life, the Universe and Everything. The idea concerns a  luxury  passenger\n', '\t\t\tstarship that suffers "sudden and gratuitous total existence failure" on its maiden voyage.\n', '\t\t\t\n', '\t\t\tWowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, a character from Life, the Universe and Everything, also appears in a short story by Adams titled "The\n', '\t\t\tPrivate Life of Genghis Khan" which appears in some early editions of The Salmon of Doubt.\n', '\n', '\tPublished radio scripts: Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins collaborated on The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the  Galaxy:  The  Original  Radio  Scripts,\n', '\tfirst published in the United Kingdom and United States in 1985. A tenth-anniversary (of the script book publication) edition was printed in 1995,\n', '\tand a twenty-fifth-anniversary (of the first radio series broadcast) edition was printed in 2003.  The 2004 series was produced by Above The Title\n', '\tProductions and the scripts were published in July 2005, with production notes for each episode. This second radio script  book  is  entitled  The\n', '\tHitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases. Douglas Adams gets the primary  writer&#39;s  credit\n', '\t(as he wrote the original novels), and there is a foreword by Simon Jones, introductions by the producer and the director, and other  introductory\n', '\tnotes from other members of the cast.\n', '\n', '\tTelevision series: The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series,  directed  and  produced  by  Alan J. W. Bell,\n', '\twhich first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981. It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly  on  the  radio\n', '\tversions of Fits the First to Sixth. A second series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and  Mark Wing-Davey  that\n', '\twould have come from Adams&#39;s abandoned Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen project (instead of simply making a TV version of the second  radio  series).\n', '\tHowever, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell involved are  all  offered  as\n', '\tcauses), and the second series was never made. Elements of Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen were instead used in the  third novel, Life, the Universe\n', '\tand Everything. The main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David Dixon as  Ford Prefect  instead  of McGivern, and Sandra\n', '\tDickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.\n', '\t\n', '\tOther television appearances: Segments of several of the books were adapted as part of the BBC&#39;s The Big Read survey and programme,  broadcast  in\n', '\tlate 2003. The film, directed by Deep Sehgal, starred Sanjeev Bhaskar as Arthur Dent, alongside Spencer Brown as Ford Prefect, Nigel Planer as the\n', '\tvoice of Marvin, Stephen Hawking as the voice of Deep Thought, Patrick Moore as the voice of the Guide, Roger Lloyd-Pack  as  Slartibartfast,  and\n', '\tAdam Buxton and Joe Cornish as Loonquawl and Phouchg.\n', '\n', '\tRadio series three to five: On 21 June 2004, the BBC announced in a press release that a new series of Hitchhiker&#39;s based on the third novel would\n', '\tbe broadcast as part of its autumn schedule, produced by Above the Title Productions Ltd. The episodes were recorded  in  late  2003,  but  actual\n', '\ttransmission was delayed while an agreement was  reached  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  over  Internet  re-broadcasts,  as  Disney  had  begun\n', '\tpre-production on the film. This was followed by news that further series would be produced based on the  fourth  and  fifth  novels.  These  were\n', '\tbroadcast in September and October 2004 and May and June 2005. CD releases accompanied the transmission of the final episode in each  series.  The\n', '\tadaptation of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio  series  in\n', '\tcomparison to the second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur happened in\n', '\ta different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in Mostly  Harmless\n', '\tare now foreshadowed in the adaptation of So Long and Thanks For All The Fish,  while  both  include  some  additional  material  that  builds  on\n', '\tincidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together,  most  especially  including  the  character  Zaphod  more\n', '\tprominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality  to  include  the  events  of  the  Secondary Phase.  While  Mostly  Harmless\n', '\toriginally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending  it  on  a  much  more\n', '\tupbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time. The core cast for the third to fifth radio series remained the same, except for the replacement  of\n', '\tPeter Jones by William Franklyn as the Book, and Richard Vernon by Richard Griffiths as Slartibartfast, since both had  died.  (Homage  to  Jones&#39;\n', '\ticonic portrayal of the Book was paid twice: the gradual shift of voices to a "new" version in episode 13, launching the new  productions,  and  a\n', '\tblend of Jones and Franklyn&#39;s voices at the end of the final episode, the first part of Maggs&#39; alternative ending.) Sandra Dickinson,  who  played\n', '\tTrillian in the TV series, here played Tricia McMillan, an English-born, American-accented alternate-universe version  of  Trillian,  while  David\n', '\tDixon, the television series&#39; Ford Prefect, made a cameo appearance as the "Ecological Man". Jane Horrocks appeared in the new  semi-regular  role\n', '\tof Fenchurch, Arthur&#39;s girlfriend, and Samantha B&#233;art joined in the final series as Arthur and Trillian&#39;s daughter,  Random Dent.  Also  reprising\n', '\ttheir roles from the original radio series were Jonathan Pryce as Zarniwoop (here blended  with  a  character  from  the  final  novel  to  become\n', '\tZarniwoop Vann Harl), Rula Lenska as Lintilla and her clones (and also as the  Voice  of  the  Bird),  and  Roy  Hudd  as  Milliways  compere  Max\n', '\tQuordlepleen, as well as the original radio series&#39; announcer, John Marsh. The series also featured guest appearances by such noted  personalities\n', '\tas Joanna Lumley as the Sydney Opera House Woman, Jackie Mason as the East River Creature, Miriam Margolyes as the  Smelly Photocopier Woman,  BBC\n', '\tRadio cricket legends Henry Blofeld and Fred Trueman as themselves, June Whitfield as the Raffle Woman,  Leslie Phillips as Hactar,  Saeed Jaffrey\n', '\tas the Man on the Pole, Sir Patrick Moore as himself, and Christian Slater as Wonko the Sane. Finally, Adams himself played the role of Agrajag, a\n', '\tperformance adapted from his book-on-tape reading of the third novel, and edited into the series created  some  time  after  the  author&#39;s  death.\n', '\n', '\tTertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phase Main cast:\n', '\t\tSimon Jones as Arthur Dent\n', '\t\tGeoffrey McGivern as Ford Prefect\n', '\t\tSusan Sheridan as Trillian\n', '\t\tMark Wing-Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox\n', '\t\tStephen Moore as Marvin, the Paranoid Android\n', '\t\tRichard Griffiths as Slartibartfast\n', '\t\tSandra Dickinson as Tricia McMillan\n', '\t\tJane Horrocks as Fenchurch\n', '\t\tRula Lenska as the Voice of the Bird\n', '\t\tSamantha B&#233;art as Random\n', '\t\tWilliam Franklyn as The Book\n', '\t\n', '\tRadio series six: The first of six episodes in a sixth series, the Hexagonal  Phase, was broadcast on  BBC Radio 4  on  8 March 2018 and  featured\n', '\tProfessor Stephen Hawking  introducing  himself as the voice of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Mk II  by  saying: "I have been quite popular\n', '\tin my time. Some even read my books."\n', '\n', '\tFilm: After several years of setbacks and renewed efforts to start production and a quarter of a century after the first book  was  published, the\n', '\tbig-screen adaptation of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy was finally shot. Pre-production began in 2003, filming began on  19 April 2004  and\n', '\tpost-production began in early September 2004. After a London premiere on 20 April 2005, it was released on 28 April in  the  UK and Australia, 29\n', '\tApril in the United States and Canada, and 29 July in South Africa. (A full list of release dates is available  at  the  IMDb.)  The  movie  stars\n', '\tMartin Freeman as Arthur, Mos Def as Ford, Sam Rockwell as President of the  Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian,  with  Alan\n', '\tRickman providing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android (and Warwick Davis acting in Marvin&#39;s costume), and Stephen Fry as  the  voice  of  the\n', '\tGuide/Narrator. The plot of the film adaptation of Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide differs widely from that of the radio show, book and television  series. The\n', '\tromantic triangle between Arthur, Zaphod, and Trillian is more prominent in the film; and visits to Vogsphere, the homeworld of the Vogons (which,\n', '\tin the books, was already abandoned), and Viltvodle VI are inserted. The film covers roughly events in  the  first four radio episodes,  and  ends\n', '\twith the characters en route to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, leaving the opportunity for a sequel open. A unique appearance is  made\n', '\tby the Point-of-View Gun, a device specifically created by Adams himself for the movie. Commercially the film was a  modest  success,  taking  $21\n', '\tmillion in its opening weekend in the United States, and nearly &#163;3.3 million in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom. The film  was  released\n', '\ton DVD (Region 2, PAL) in the UK on 5 September 2005. Both a standard double-disc edition and a UK-exclusive numbered  limited edition  "Giftpack"\n', '\twere released on this date. The "Giftpack" edition includes a copy of the novel with a "movie tie-in" cover, and collectible prints from the film,\n', '\tpackaged in a replica of the film&#39;s version of the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide prop. A single-disc widescreen or full-screen edition (Region 1, NTSC)  were\n', '\tmade available in the United States and Canada on 13 September 2005. Single-disc releases in the Blu-ray format and UMD format for the PlayStation\n', '\tPortable were also released on the respective dates in these three countries.\n', '\t\n', '\tStage shows: There have been multiple professional and amateur stage adaptations of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. There were  three  early\n', '\tprofessional productions, which were staged in 1979 and 1980. The first of these was performed  at  the  Institute of Contemporary Arts in London,\n', '\tbetween 1 and 19 May 1979, starring Chris Langham as Arthur Dent (Langham later returned to Hitchhiker&#39;s as Prak in the final  episode  of  2004&#39;s\n', '\tTertiary Phase) and Richard Hope as Ford Prefect. This show was adapted from the first series&#39; scripts and was directed by Ken Campbell, who  went\n', '\ton to perform a character in the final episode of the second radio series. The show ran 90 minutes, but had an audience limited to  eighty  people\n', '\tper night. Actors performed on a variety of ledges and platforms, and the audience was pushed around in a hovercar, 1/2000th of an inch above  the\n', '\tfloor. This was the first time that Zaphod was represented by having two actors in one large  costume.  The  narration  of  "The Book"  was  split\n', '\tbetween two usherettes, an adaptation that has appeared in no other version of H2G2. One of  these  usherettes,  Cindy Oswin,  went  on  to  voice\n', '\tTrillian for the LP adaptation. The second stage show was  performed  throughout  Wales  between  15 January  and  23 February 1980.  This  was  a\n', '\tproduction of Clwyd Theatr Cymru, and was directed by Jonathan Petherbridge. The company performed adaptations  of  complete  radio  episodes,  at\n', '\ttimes doing two episodes in a night, and at other times doing all six episodes of the first series in single three-hour sessions. This  adaptation\n', '\twas performed again at the Oxford Playhouse in December 1981, the Bristol Hippodrome, Plymouth&#39;s Theatre Royal in May–June 1982, and also  at  the\n', '\tBelgrade Theatre, Coventry, in July 1983. The third and least successful stage show was held at the Rainbow Theatre in London, in July 1980.  This\n', '\twas the second production directed by Ken Campbell. The Rainbow Theatre had been adapted for stagings of  rock  operas  in  the  1970s,  and  both\n', '\treference books mentioned in footnotes indicate that this, coupled with incidental music throughout the  performance,  caused  some  reviewers  to\n', '\tlabel it as a "musical". This was the first adaptation for which Adams wrote the "Dish of the Day" sequence. The production  ran  for  over  three\n', '\thours, and was widely panned for this, as well as for the music, laser effects, and the acting. Despite attempts to shorten the script,  and  make\n', '\tother changes, it closed three or four weeks early (accounts differ), and lost a lot of money. Despite the bad reviews, there were  at  least  two\n', '\tstand-out performances: Michael Cule and David Learner both went on from this production to appearances in the  TV adaptation. In  December 2011 a\n', '\tnew stage production was announced to begin touring in June 2012. This included members of the original radio and TV casts  such  as  Simon Jones,\n', '\tGeoff McGivern, Susan Sheridan, Mark Wing-Davey and Stephen Moore with VIP guests playing the role of the Book. It was produced in the form  of  a\n', '\tradio show which could be downloaded when the tour was completed. This production was based on the first four Fits in  the  first  act,  with  the\n', '\tsecond act covering material from the rest of the series. The show also featured a band, who performed the songs  "Share and Enjoy",  the  Krikkit\n', '\tsong "Under the Ink Black Sky", Marvin&#39;s song "How I Hate The Night", and "Marvin", which was a minor hit  in  1981.  The  production  featured  a\n', '\tseries of "VIP guests" as the voice of  The Book  including  Billy Boyd,  Phill Jupitus,  Rory McGrath,  Roger McGough,  Jon Culshaw,  Christopher\n', '\tTimothy, Andrew Sachs, John Challis, Hugh Dennis, John Lloyd, Terry Jones and Neil Gaiman. The tour started on 8 June 2012 at  the  Theatre Royal,\n', '\tGlasgow and continued through the summer until 21 July when the final performance was at  Playhouse Theatre,  Edinburgh.  The  production  started\n', '\ttouring again in September 2013, but the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\n', '\t\n', '\tLive radio adaptation: On Saturday 29 March 2014, Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation in front of a live  audience,  featuring  many  members  of  the\n', '\toriginal cast including Stephen Moore, Susan Sheridan,  Mark Wing-Davey,  Simon Jones  and  Geoff McGivern,  with  John Lloyd  as  the  book.  The\n', '\tadaptation was adapted by Dirk Maggs primarily from Fit the First, including material from the books and later radio Fits  as  well  as  some  new\n', '\tjokes. It formed part of Radio 4&#39;s Character Invasion series. \n', '\t\n', '\tLP album adaptations: The first four radio episodes were adapted for a new double LP, also entitled The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy (appended\n', '\twith "Part One" for the subsequent Canadian release), first by mail-order only, and  later  into  stores.  The  double  LP  and  its  sequel  were\n', '\toriginally released by Original Records in the United Kingdom in 1979 and 1980, with the catalogue numbers ORA042  and  ORA054  respectively. They\n', '\twere first released by Hannibal Records in 1982 (as HNBL 2301 and HNBL 1307, respectively) in the United States and Canada, and later  re-released\n', '\tin a slightly abridged edition by Simon & Schuster&#39;s Audioworks in the mid-1980s. Both  were  produced  by  Geoffrey Perkins  and  featured  cover\n', '\tartwork by Hipgnosis. The script in the first double LP very closely follows the first four radio episodes, although further cuts had to  be  made\n', '\tfor reasons of timing. Despite this, other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when  the  original  scripts  from  the  radio\n', '\tseries were eventually published can be  heard  in  the  LP  version.  The  Simon & Schuster  cassettes  omit  the  Veet Voojagig  narration,  the\n', '\tcheerleader&#39;s speech as Deep Thought concludes its seven-and-one-half-million-year programme, and a few other lines from both sides of the  second\n', '\tLP of the set. Most of the original cast returned, except for Susan Sheridan, who was recording a voice for the character of  Princess Eilonwy  in\n', '\tThe Black Cauldron for Walt Disney Pictures. Cindy Oswin voiced Trillian on all three LPs in her place. Other casting changes in the  first double\n', '\tLP included Stephen Moore taking on the additional role of the barman, and Valentine Dyall as the voice of  Deep Thought.  Adams&#39;s  voice  can  be\n', '\theard making the public address announcements on Magrathea. Because of copyright issues, the music used during the first radio series  was  either\n', '\treplaced, or in the case of the title it was re-recorded in a  new  arrangement.  Composer  Tim Souster  did  both  duties  (with  Paddy Kingsland\n', '\tcontributing music as well), and Souster&#39;s version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series.  The  sequel LP  was\n', '\treleased, singly, as The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy Part Two: The Restaurant at the End of the  Universe  in  the  UK,  and  simply  as  The\n', '\tRestaurant at the End of the Universe in the USA. The script here mostly follows Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth,  but  includes  a  song  by  the\n', '\tbackup band in the restaurant ("Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo"), and changes the Haggunenon sequence to "Disaster Area". As the result  of\n', '\ta misunderstanding, the second record was released before being cut down in a final edit that Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins had both intended\n', '\tto make. Perkins has said, "[I]t is far too long on each side. It&#39;s  just  a  rough cut. [...] I felt it was flabby, and I wanted to speed it up."\n', '\tThe Simon & Schuster Audioworks re-release of this LP was also abridged slightly from its  original  release.  The  scene  with  Ford Prefect  and\n', '\tHotblack Desiato&#39;s bodyguard is omitted. Sales for the first double-LP release were primarily through mail order. Total sales reached over  60,000\n', '\tunits, with half of those being mail order, and the other half through retail outlets. This  is  in  spite  of  the  facts  that Original Records&#39;\n', '\twarehouse ordered and stocked more copies than they were actually selling for quite some time, and that Paul Neil Milne Johnstone complained about\n', '\this name and then-current address being included in the recording. This was corrected for a later pressing of the double-LP by "cut[ting] up  that\n', '\tpart of the master tape and reassembl[ing] it in the wrong order". The second LP release ("Part Two") also only sold a total of  60,000  units  in\n', '\tthe UK. The distribution deals for the United States and Canada with Hannibal Records and Simon and Schuster  were  later  negotiated  by  Douglas\n', '\tAdams and his agent, Ed Victor, after gaining full rights to the recordings from Original Records, which went bankrupt.\n', '\n', '\tAudiobook adaptations: There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition  (ISBN 0-671-62964-6),  recorded\n', '\tin the mid-1980s for the EMI label Music For Pleasure by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice  of  Marvin the Paranoid Android  in  the\n', '\tradio series and in the TV series. In 1990,  Adams  himself  recorded  an  unabridged  edition  for  Dove Audiobooks  (ISBN 1-55800-273-1),  later\n', '\tre-released by New Millennium Audio (ISBN 1-59007-257-X)  in  the  United States  and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. Also by\n', '\tarrangement with Dove, ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by Douglas Adams (ISBN 1-85695-028-X) in 1994.  To  tie-in\n', '\twith the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film&#39;s voice of the Guide, recorded a second  unabridged  edition  (ISBN 0-7393-2220-6).  In  addition,\n', '\tunabridged versions of books 2-5 of the  series were recorded by Martin Freeman for Random House Audio. Freeman plays  Arthur  in  the  2005  film\n', '\tadaptation. Audiobooks 2-5 follow in order  and  include: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (ISBN 9780739332085);  Life, the Universe, and\n', '\tEverything (ISBN 9780739332108); So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (ISBN 9780739332122); and Mostly Harmless (ISBN 9780739332146).\n', '\n', '\tInteractive fiction and video games: Sometime between 1982 and 1984  (accounts differ), the  British  company  Supersoft  published  a  text-based\n', '\tadventure game based on the book, which was released in versions for the Commodore PET and Commodore 64. One  account  states  that  there  was  a\n', '\tdispute as to whether valid permission for publication had been granted, and following legal action the  game  was  withdrawn  and  all  remaining\n', '\tcopies were destroyed. Another account states that the programmer, Bob Chappell, rewrote the game  to  remove  all  Hitchhiker&#39;s  references,  and\n', '\trepublished it as "Cosmic Capers". Officially, the TV series was followed in 1984 by a best-selling "interactive fiction", or text-based adventure\n', '\tgame, distributed by Infocom. It was designed by Adams and Infocom regular Steve Meretzky and was one of Infocom&#39;s most successful games. As  with\n', '\tmany Infocom games, the box contained a number of "feelies" including a  "Don&#39;t panic" badge,  some  "pocket fluff",  a  pair  of  peril-sensitive\n', '\tsunglasses (made of cardboard), an order for the destruction of the Earth, a small, clear plastic bag containing "a microscopic battle fleet"  and\n', '\tan order for the destruction of Arthur Dent&#39;s house  (signed by Adams and Meretzky).  In  September 2004,  it  was  revived  by  the  BBC  on  the\n', '\tHitchhiker&#39;s section of the Radio 4 website for the initial broadcast of the Tertiary Phase, and is still  available  to  play  online.  This  new\n', '\tversion uses an original Infocom datafile with a custom-written interpreter, by Sean Soll&#233;, and Flash programming by Shimon Young,  both  of  whom\n', '\tused to work at The Digital Village (TDV). The new version includes illustrations by Rod Lord, who was head of Pearce Animation Studios  in  1980,\n', '\twhich produced the guide graphics for the TV series. On 2 March 2005 it won the Interactive BAFTA in the "best online entertainment"  category.  A\n', '\tsequel to the original Infocom game was never made. An all-new, fully graphical game was designed and developed by a  joint  venture  between  The\n', '\tDigital Village and PAN Interactive (no connection to Pan Books / Pan Mcmillan). This new game was planned and  developed  between  1998 and 2002,\n', '\tbut like the sequel to the Infocom game, it also never materialised. In April 2005, Starwave Mobile released two mobile  games  to  accompany  the\n', '\trelease of the film adaptation. The first, developed by Atatio, was called "The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy: Vogon Planet Destructor". It was\n', '\ta typical top-down shooter and except for the title had little to do with the actual story. The second game,  developed  by  TKO Software,  was  a\n', '\tgraphical adventure game named "The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game". Despite  its  name,  the  newly  designed  puzzles  by  TKO\n', '\tSoftware&#39;s Ireland studio were different from the Infocom ones, and the game followed the movie&#39;s script closely and included the  new  characters\n', '\tand places. The "Adventure Game" won the IGN&#39;s "Editors&#39; Choice Award" in May 2005. On 25 May 2011, Hothead Games announced they were working on a\n', '\tnew edition of The Guide. Along with the announcement, Hothead Games launched a teaser web site made to look like an  announcement  from  Megadodo\n', '\tPublications that The Guide will soon be available on Earth. It has since been revealed that they are developing an iOS app in the  style  of  the\n', '\tfictional Guide.\n', '\t\n', '\tComic books: In 1993, DC Comics, in conjunction with Byron Preiss Visual Publications,  published  a  three-part  comic  book  adaptation  of  the\n', '\tnovelisation of The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. This was followed up with three-part adaptations  of  The  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the\n', '\tUniverse in 1994, and Life, the Universe and Everything in 1996. There was also a series of collectors&#39; cards with art from and  inspired  by  the\n', '\tcomic adaptations of the first book, and a graphic novelisation (or "collected edition") combining the three individual  comic  books  from  1993,\n', '\titself released in May 1997. Douglas Adams was deeply opposed to the use of American English spellings and idioms in  what  he  felt  was  a  very\n', '\tBritish story, and had to be talked into it by the American publishers, although he remained very unhappy with  the  compromise.  The  adaptations\n', '\twere scripted by John Carnell. Steve Leialoha provided the art for Hitchhiker&#39;s and the layouts for Restaurant. Shepherd Hendrix did the  finished\n', '\tart for Restaurant. Neil Vokes and John Nyberg did the finished artwork for Life, based on breakdowns by Paris Cullins  (Book 1)  and  Christopher\n', '\tSchenck (Books 2–3). The miniseries were edited by Howard Zimmerman and Ken Grobe.\n', '\t\n', '\t"Hitch-Hikeriana": Many merchandising and spin-off items (or "Hitch-Hikeriana") were produced in the early 1980s, including  towels  in  different\n', '\tcolours, all bearing the Guide entry for towels. Later runs of towels include those made for promotions by Pan Books, Touchstone Pictures / Disney\n', '\tfor the 2005 movie, and different towels made for ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha,  the official Hitchhiker&#39;s Appreciation  society.  Other  items  that  first\n', '\tappeared in the mid-1980s were T-shirts, including those made for Infocom (such as one bearing the legend "I got the Babel Fish" for  successfully\n', '\tcompleting one of that game&#39;s most difficult puzzles), and a Disaster Area tour T-shirt. Other official items have included  "Beeblebears"  (teddy\n', '\tbears with an extra head and arm, named after Hitchhiker&#39;s character Zaphod Beeblebrox, sold by the official Appreciation Society), an  assortment\n', '\tof pin-on buttons and a number of novelty singles. Many of the above items  are  displayed  throughout  the  2004  "25th  Anniversary  Illustrated\n', '\tEdition" of the novel, which used items from the personal collections of fans of the  series.  Stephen  Moore  recorded  two  novelty  singles  in\n', '\tcharacter as Marvin, the Paranoid Android: "Marvin"/"Metal Man" and "Reasons To Be Miserable"/"Marvin I Love You". The last song has appeared on a\n', '\tDr. Demento compilation. Another single featured the re-recorded "Journey of the Sorcerer" (arranged by Tim Souster) backed  with  "Reg Nullify In\n', '\tConcert" by Reg Nullify, and "Only the End of the World Again" by Disaster Area (including Douglas Adams on bass guitar). These  discs  have since\n', '\tbecome collector&#39;s items.  The 2005 movie also added quite a few collectibles, mostly through the National Entertainment Collectibles Association.\n', '\tThese included three prop  replicas  of objects seen on the Vogon ship and homeworld (a mug, a pen and a stapler), sets of "action figures" with a\n', '\theight of either 3 or 6 inches (76 or 150 mm), a gun—based on a prop used by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, that shoots foam darts, a crystal cube,\n', '\tshot glasses, a ten-inch (254 mm) high version of  Marvin  with  eyes  that light up green, and "yarn doll" versions of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect,\n', '\tTrillian, Marvin and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Also, various audio tracks were released to coincide with the movie, notably re-recordings of "Marvin" and\n', '\t"Reasons To Be Miserable", sung by Stephen Fry, along with some of the "Guide Entries",  newly  written  material read in-character by Fry. SpaceX\n', '\tCEO Elon Musk launched his Tesla Roadster into an elliptical heliocentric orbit as part of the initial test launch of  the  Falcon Heavy.  On  the\n', '\tcar&#39;s dashboard, the phrase "Don&#39;t Panic!" appears, as a nod to the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide.\n', '\t\n', '\tInternational phenomenon: Many science fiction fans and radio listeners outside the United Kingdom were first exposed to The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to\n', '\tthe Galaxy in one of two ways: shortwave radio broadcasts of the original radio series, or by Douglas Adams being "Guest of Honour"  at  the  1979\n', '\tWorld Science Fiction Convention, Seacon, held in Brighton, England. It was there that the radio series was nominated for a Hugo Award (the  first\n', '\tradio series to receive a nomination) but lost to Superman. A convention exclusively for H2G2, Hitchercon I, was held  in  Glasgow,  Scotland,  in\n', '\tSeptember 1980, the year that the official fan club, ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha, was organised. In the early 1980s, versions  of  H2G2 became available in\n', '\tthe United States, Canada, Germany (Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis), Denmark (H&#229;ndbog for vakse galakseblaffere), the Netherlands (Transgalactisch\n', '\tLiftershandboek), Sweden (Liftarens guide till galaxen), Finland (Linnunradan K&#228;sikirja Liftareille) and also Israel (מדריך הטרמפיסט לגלקסיה).

The novel is an adaptation of the first four parts of Adams&#39; radio series of the same  name.  The  novel  was  first  published  in\n', '\tLondon on 12 October 1979. It sold 250,000 copies in the first three months.  The  namesake  of  the  novel  is  The  Hitchhiker&#39;s  Guide  to  the\n', '\tGalaxy, a fictional guide book for hitchhikers (inspired  by the  Hitch-hiker&#39;s  Guide  to  Europe)  written  in  the  form  of  an  encyclopedia.\n', '\tPlot summary: The book begins with city council workmen arriving at  Arthur Dent&#39;s  house. They  wish  to  demolish  his house in order to build a\n', '\tbypass. Arthur&#39;s best friend, Ford Prefect, arrives, warning him of the end of the world. Ford is  revealed  to  be  an  alien  who  had  come  to\n', '\tEarth to research it for the titular Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, an enormous work providing  information  about  every  planet  and place in\n', '\tthe universe. The two head to a pub, where the locals question Ford&#39;s knowledge of the Apocalypse. An alien race, known  as  Vogons,  show  up  to\n', '\tdemolish Earth in order to build a bypass for an intergalactic highway. Arthur and Ford manage to get onto the Vogon ship  just  before  Earth  is\n', '\tdemolished, where they are forced to listen to horrible Vogon poetry as a form of torture. Arthur and Ford  are  ordered  to  say  how  much  they\n', '\tlike the poetry in order to avoid being thrown out of the airlock, and while Ford finds  listening  to  be  painful,  Arthur  believes  it  to  be\n', '\tgenuinely good, since human poetry is apparently even worse. Arthur and Ford are then placed into the airlock  and  jettisoned  into  space,  only\n', '\tto  be  rescued  by  Zaphod Beeblebrox&#39;s  ship,  the Heart of Gold.  Zaphod, a  semi-cousin  of  Ford,  is  the  President of the Galaxy,  and  is\n', '\taccompanied by a depressed robot named Marvin and a human woman by the name of Trillian. The five embark  on  a  journey  to  find  the  legendary\n', '\tplanet known as  Magrathea,  known  for  selling  luxury  planets.  Once  there,  they  are  taken  into  the  planet&#39;s  centre  by  a  man  named\n', '\tSlartibartfast. There,  they  learn  that  a  supercomputer  named  Deep Thought,  who  determined  the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and\n', '\teverything to be the number 42, created Earth as an even greater computer to calculate  the  question  to  which  42  is  the  answer.  Trillian&#39;s\n', '\tmice, actually part of the group of sentient and hyper-intelligent superbeings that  had  Earth  created  in  the  first place, reject the idea of\n', '\tbuilding a second Earth to redo the process, and offer to  buy  Arthur&#39;s brain in the hope that it contains  the  question,  leading  to  a  fight\n', '\twhen  he  declines.  Zaphod  saves  Arthur  when the brain is about to be removed, and the group decides to go to The Restaurant at the End of the\n', '\tUniverse.\n', '\t\t\n', '\tIllustrated edition: The Illustrated Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy is a specially designed book made in 1994.  It  was  first  printed  in  the\n', '\tUnited Kingdom by Weidenfeld & Nicolson and in  the  United States by Harmony Books  (who sold it for $42.00).  It  is an oversized book, and came\n', '\tin silver-foil "holographic" covers in both the  UK and US  markets.  It  features  the  first  appearance  of  the  42  Puzzle, designed by Adams\n', '\thimself, a photograph of Adams and his literary agent Ed Victor as  the  two  space  cops,  and  many  other  designs  by  Kevin Davies,  who  has\n', '\tparticipated in many Hitchhiker&#39;s related projects since the stage  productions  in  the  late  1970s.  Davies  himself  appears  as Prosser. This\n', '\tedition is out of print – Adams bought up many remainder copies and sold them, autographed, on his website.\n', '\t\t\n', '\tIn other media:  Audiobook  adaptations:  There  have  been  three  audiobook  recordings  of  the  novel.  The  first  was  an  abridged  edition\n', '\t(ISBN 0-671-62964-6), recorded in the mid-1980s by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice  of  Marvin  the  Paranoid Android in the radio\n', '\tseries, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded  an  unabridged  edition  for  Dove Audiobooks  (ISBN 1-55800-273-1),\n', '\tlater re-released by New Millennium Audio (ISBN 1-59007-257-X)  in  the  United  States  and  available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom.\n', '\tAlso by arrangement with Dove, ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by  Douglas Adams  (ISBN 1-85695-028-X)  in  1994.\n', '\tTo tie-in with the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film&#39;s voice of  the  Guide,  recorded  a  second  unabridged  edition  (ISBN 0-7393-2220-6).\n', '\n', '\tTelevision series: The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series,  directed  and  produced  by  Alan J. W. Bell,\n', '\twhich first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981. It employed many  of the  actors  from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio\n', '\tversions of Fits the First through Sixth. A second series was at one point  planned, with  a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey\n', '\tthat would have come from Adams&#39;s abandoned Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen project (instead of simply making  a  TV version  of  the  second  radio\n', '\tseries). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and  having  Alan Bell  involved  are  all\n', '\toffered as causes), and the second series was never made. Elements of Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen were instead used in  the  third  novel, Life,\n', '\tthe Universe and Everything. The main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David Dixon as Ford Prefect instead of  McGivern,\n', '\tand Sandra Dickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.\n', '\t\n', '\tFilm adaptation: The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy was adapted into a science fiction comedy film directed by Garth Jennings  and  released  on\n', '\t28 April 2005 in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and on the following day in the United States  and  Canada.

To see the most recent version of this text, visit:\n', '\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams\n', '\n', '\tDouglas Noel Adams (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English author, scriptwriter, essayist, humorist, satirist and dramatist. Adams was author\n', '\tof The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy, which originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a "trilogy" of five books that sold\n', '\tmore than 15 million copies in his lifetime and generated a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005 a feature\n', "\tfilm. Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame. Adams also  wrote  Dirk  Gently's  Holistic  Detective\n", '\tAgency (1987) and The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (1988), and co-wrote The Meaning of Liff (1983), The Deeper  Meaning  of  Liff  (1990),  Last\n', "\tChance to See (1990), and three stories for the television series Doctor Who; he also served as script editor for the show's seventeenth season in\n", '\t1979. A posthumous collection of his works, including an unfinished novel, was published as The Salmon of Doubt in 2002. Adams was an advocate for\n', '\tenvironmentalism  and  conservation,  a  lover  of  fast  cars,  technological  innovation  and  the  Apple  Macintosh,  and  a  radical  atheist.\n', '\n', '\tEarly life: Adams was born on 11 March 1952 to Janet (née Donovan; 1927–2016) and Christopher Douglas Adams (1927–1985) in Cambridge, England. The\n', '\tFamily moved to the East End of London a few months after his birth, where his sister, Susan, was born three years later. His parents divorced  in\n', '\t1957;   Douglas,  Susan,  and  their  mother  moved  to  an  RSPCA  animal  shelter  in  Brentwood,  Essex,  run  by  his  maternal  grandparents.\n', '\n', '\tEducation: Adams attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. At nine, he passed the entrance exam for  Brentwood  School,  an  independent\n', '\tschool whose alumni include Robin Day, Jack Straw, Noel Edmonds, and David Irving. Griff Rhys Jones was a year below him, and he was in  the  same\n', '\tclass as Stuckist artist Charles Thomson. He attended the prep school from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until  December 1970.  Adams  was  6\n', '\tfeet (1.8 m) by age 12 and stopped growing at 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m). His form master, Frank Halford, said his height had made him stand out and\n', '\tthat he had been self-conscious about it. His ability to write stories made him well known in the school. He became the only student  ever  to  be\n', "\tawarded a ten out of ten by Halford for creative writing, something he remembered for the rest of his  life,  particularly  when  facing  writer's\n", '\tblock. Some of his earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on its photography club in The Brentwoodian in  1962,  or  spoof\n', "\treviews in the school magazine Broadsheet, edited by Paul Neil Milne Johnstone, who later became a character in  The Hitchhiker's Guide.  He  also\n", "\tdesigned the cover of one issue of the Broadsheet, and had a letter and short story published in  The Eagle, the boys'  comic,  in  1965.  A  poem\n", '\tentitled "A Dissertation on the task of writing a poem on a candle and an account of some of the difficulties thereto pertaining" written by Adams\n', '\tin January 1970, at the age of 17, was discovered in a cupboard at the school in early 2014. On the strength  of  a  bravura  essay  on  religious\n', "\tpoetry that discussed the Beatles and William Blake, he was awarded an Exhibition in English at St John's College, Cambridge, going up in 1971. He\n", '\twanted to join the Footlights, an invitation-only student comedy club that has  acted  as  a  hothouse  for  comic  talent.  He  was  not  elected\n', '\timmediately as he had hoped, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and Martin Smith,  forming  a  group  called\n', '\t"Adams-Smith-Adams", but became a member of the Footlights by 1973. Despite doing very little work—he recalled having completed  three  essays  in\n', '\tthree years—he graduated in 1974 with a B.A. in English literature.\n', '\n', '\tCareer: Writing: After leaving university Adams moved back to London, determined to break into TV and radio as a writer. An edited version of  the\n', "\tFootlights Revue appeared on BBC2 television in 1974. A version of the Revue performed live in London's West End led to Adams being discovered  by\n", "\tMonty Python's Graham Chapman. The two formed a brief writing partnership, earning Adams a writing credit in  episode 45  of  Monty Python  for  a\n", '\tsketch called "Patient Abuse". The pair also co-wrote the "Marilyn Monroe" sketch which appeared on the soundtrack album of Monty Python  and  the\n', '\tHoly Grail. Adams is one of only two people other than the original Python members to get a writing credit (the other being Neil Innes). Adams had\n', '\ttwo brief appearances in the fourth series of Monty Python\'s Flying Circus. At the beginning of episode 42,  "The Light Entertainment War",  Adams\n', "\tis in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while  Michael  Palin  narrates  a  sketch  that\n", '\tintroduces one person after another but never gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, "Mr. Neutron", Adams is dressed in a pepper-pot outfit\n', '\tand loads a missile onto a cart driven by Terry Jones, who is calling for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The  two  episodes  were  broadcast  in\n', "\tNovember 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including Out of the Trees. At this point Adams's career stalled; his writing\n", '\tstyle was unsuited to the then-current style of radio and TV comedy. To make ends meet he took a series of  odd  jobs,  including  as  a  hospital\n', '\tporter, barn builder, and chicken shed cleaner. He was employed as a bodyguard by a Qatari family, who had made their fortune in oil. During  this\n', '\ttime Adams continued to write and submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his  career  had  a  brief  improvement  when  he  wrote  and\n', "\tperformed Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved to\n", '\tlive with his mother. The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams\'s life; "I have terrible periods of  lack\n', "\tof confidence. I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather –\n", '\tyou just have to get on with it". Some of Adams\'s early radio work included sketches for The Burkiss Way in 1977 and The News Huddlines.  He  also\n', '\twrote, again with Chapman, the 20 February 1977 episode of Doctor on the Go, a sequel to the Doctor in the House television comedy  series.  After\n', "\tthe first radio series of The Hitchhiker's Guide became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on Week Ending  and  a  pantomime\n", '\tcalled Black Cinderella Two Goes East. He left after six months to become the script editor for Doctor Who. In 1979  Adams  and  John Lloyd  wrote\n', '\tscripts for two half-hour episodes of Doctor Snuggles: "The Remarkable Fidgety River" and  "The Great Disappearing Mystery"  (episodes  eight  and\n', '\ttwelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original Hitchhiker radio series ("Fit the Fifth" and "Fit the Sixth", also  known\n', '\tas "Episode Five" and "Episode Six"), as well as The Meaning of Liff and The Deeper Meaning of Liff.\n', '\n', "\tThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a concept for a science-fiction  comedy  radio  series  pitched  by\n", '\tAdams and radio producer Simon Brett to BBC Radio 4 in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as  a  few  other  stories\n', "\t(reprinted in Neil Gaiman's book Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion) that could be used in the series. According\n", '\tto Adams, the idea for the title occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a  copy\n', '\tof the Hitch-hiker\'s Guide to Europe, and it occurred to him that "somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy". He later said that\n', '\tthe constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event. Despite the original outline, Adams was said to  make  up\n', '\tthe stories as he wrote. He turned to John Lloyd for help with the final two episodes  of  the  first  series.  Lloyd  contributed  bits  from  an\n', "\tunpublished science fiction book of his own, called GiGax. Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of Hitchhiker's, such  as\n", '\tthe novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely  re-written.\n', '\tBBC Radio 4 broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. The series was distributed in the United States by National\n', '\tPublic Radio. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly  known  as  the  Christmas\n', '\tEpisode. A second series of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of 21–25 January 1980. While working on  the  radio  series\n', '\t(and with simultaneous projects such as The Pirate Planet) Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that got worse  as  he  published\n', '\tnovels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in  a  hotel  suite\n', '\twith his editor for three weeks to ensure that So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish was completed. He was quoted as saying,  "I love deadlines.  I\n', '\tlove the whooshing noise they make as they go by." Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams wrote five novels  in  the  series,  published  in\n', '\t1979, 1980, 1982, 1984, and 1992. The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book  adaptations  for  each  of  the\n', '\tfirst three books, an interactive text-adventure computer game, and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a\n', "\t42 Puzzle designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four Hitchhiker's novels (the paperback for the fifth\n", "\tre-used the artwork from the hardback edition). In 1980 Adams began attempts to turn the first Hitchhiker's novel  into  a  film,  making  several\n", '\ttrips to Los Angeles, and working with Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, the radio series  became  the  basis  for  a  BBC\n', '\ttelevision mini-series broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started  with\n', '\tDisney, which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay got a posthumous re-write by Karey Kirkpatrick, and the resulting film was released in\n', '\t2005. Radio producer Dirk Maggs had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based  on\n', "\tthe third novel in the Hitchhiker's series. They also discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels  in  the  five-book\n", '\t"trilogy". As with the movie, this project was realised only after Adams\'s death. The third series, The Tertiary Phase, was broadcast on BBC Radio\n', '\t4 in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of Life, the Universe and Everything and\n', '\tediting, Adams can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish and Mostly Harmless made up the  fourth\n', '\tand fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled The Quandary Phase and The Quintessential Phase) and these were broadcast  in  May\n', '\tand June 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, "more upbeat" ending) concluded  with,\n', '\t"The very final episode of The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author."\n', '\n', "\tDirk Gently series: Between Adams's first trip to Madagascar with Mark Carwardine in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the  basis  for\n", "\tthe radio series and non-fiction book Last Chance to See, Adams wrote two other novels  with  a  new  cast  of  characters. Dirk Gently's Holistic\n", '\tDetective Agency was published in 1987, and was described by  its  author  as  "a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic,\n', '\tmainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics". It was derived from two Doctor Who serials Adams had  written.  A  sequel,  The Long Dark\n', "\tTea-Time of the Soul, was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's  first  since  So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.\n", '\tAfter  the  book  tour,  Adams  set  off  on  his  round-the-world  excursion  which  supplied  him  with  the  material  for  Last Chance to See.\n', '\n', '\tDoctor Who: Adams sent the script for the HHGG pilot radio programme to the Doctor Who production office in 1978, and was  commissioned  to  write\n', '\tThe Pirate Planet (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen",  which\n', "\tlater became his novel Life, the Universe and Everything (which in turn became the third Hitchhiker's Guide radio series). Adams then went  on  to\n", '\tserve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three Doctor Who serials  starring  Tom Baker  as  the\n', '\tDoctor: "The Pirate Planet" (the second serial in the "Key to Time" arc, in season 16) "City of Death" (with  producer  Graham Williams,  from  an\n', '\toriginal storyline by writer David Fisher. It was transmitted under the pseudonym "David Agnew") "Shada" (only partially filmed; not televised due\n', '\tto industry disputes) The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that were not novelised as Adams would not allow  anyone  else  to  write\n', '\tthem, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay. "Shada" was later adapted as a novel by  Gareth Roberts  in  2012  and\n', '\t"City of Death" and "The Pirate Planet" by James Goss in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Elements of Shada and City of Death were  reused  in  Adams\'s\n', "\tlater novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, in particular the character of Professor Chronotis. Big Finish Productions eventually  remade\n", '\tShada as an audio play starring Paul McGann as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was webcast on the BBC  website  in\n', '\t2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on  the  digital  radio  station\n', '\tBBC7 on 10 December 2005. In the Doctor Who 2012 Christmas episode The Snowmen, writer Steven Moffat  was  inspired  by  a  storyline  that  Adams\n', '\tpitched called The Doctor Retires.\n', '\n', '\tMusic: Adams played the guitar left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died (having received his first  guitar\n', "\tin 1964). He also studied piano in the 1960s with the same teacher as Paul Wickens, the pianist who plays in Paul McCartney's band  (and  composed\n", "\tthe music for the 2004–2005 editions of the Hitchhiker's Guide radio series). Pink Floyd and Procol Harum had important influence on Adams'  work.\n", '\n', '\tPink Floyd: Adams\'s official biography shares its name with the song  "Wish You Were Here"  by  Pink Floyd.  Adams  was  friends  with  Pink Floyd\n', "\tguitarist David Gilmour and, on Adams's 42nd birthday, he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd's concert of  28  October  1994  at\n", '\tEarls Court in London, playing guitar on the songs "Brain Damage" and "Eclipse". Adams chose the name  for  Pink Floyd\'s 1994 album,  The Division\n', '\tBell, by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, "High Hopes". Gilmour also performed at Adams\'s memorial  service  in  2001,  and\n', "\twhat would have been Adams's 60th birthday party in 2012.\n", '\t\n', '\tComputer games and projects: Douglas Adams created an interactive fiction version of HHGG with Steve Meretzky from Infocom in  1984.  In  1986  he\n', '\tparticipated in a week-long brainstorming session with the Lucasfilm Games team for the game Labyrinth. Later he was  also  involved  in  creating\n', '\tBureaucracy as a parody of events in his own life. Adams was a founder-director and Chief Fantasist of The Digital Village, a  digital  media  and\n', '\tInternet company with which he created Starship Titanic, a Codie Award-winning and BAFTA-nominated adventure game, which was published in 1998  by\n', "\tSimon & Schuster. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled Douglas Adams' Starship Titanic, since Adams was too busy  with  the  computer\n", "\tgame to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the H2G2 collaborative writing project, an experimental attempt at  making  The Hitchhiker's Guide\n", '\tto the Galaxy a reality, and at harnessing the collective brainpower of the internet community. It was hosted by BBC Online from 2001 to 2011.  In\n', '\t1990, Adams wrote and presented a television documentary programme Hyperland which featured  Tom Baker  as  a  "software agent"  (similar  to  the\n', "\tassistant pictured in Apple's Knowledge Navigator video of future concepts  from  1987),  and  interviews  with  Ted Nelson,  the  co-inventor  of\n", '\thypertext and the person who coined the term. Adams was an early adopter and advocate of hypertext.\n', '\n', '\tPersonal beliefs and activism: Atheism and views on religion: Adams described himself as a "radical atheist", adding "radical" for emphasis so  he\n', '\twould not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it.  He  imagined  a  sentient\n', '\tpuddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, "This is an interesting world I find myself in – an interesting hole I find myself in – fits me rather\n', '\tneatly, doesn\'t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" to  demonstrate  his  view  that  the  fine-tuned\n', '\tUniverse argument for God was a fallacy. He remained fascinated by religion because of its effect  on  human  affairs.  "I love to keep poking and\n', '\tprodding at it. I\'ve thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill  over  into  my  writing."  The  evolutionary\n', "\tbiologist and atheist Richard Dawkins uses Adams's influence to exemplify arguments for non-belief in  his  2006  book  The God Delusion.  Dawkins\n", '\tdedicated the book to Adams, whom he jokingly called "possibly [my] only convert" to atheism and  wrote  on  his  death  that  "Science has lost a\n', '\tfriend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender."\n', '\n', '\tEnvironmental activism: Adams was also an environmental activist who campaigned on behalf  of  endangered  species.  This  activism  included  the\n', '\tproduction of the non-fiction radio series Last Chance to See, in which he and naturalist Mark Carwardine visited rare species such as the  kakapo\n', '\tand baiji, and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992 this was made into a CD-ROM combination of audiobook, e-book and picture\n', "\tslide show. Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from Last Chance to See to the book The Great Ape Project.  This\n", '\tbook, edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for  the  extension  of  moral  equality  to\n', '\tinclude all great apes, human and non-human. In 1994, he participated in a climb of Mount Kilimanjaro while wearing a rhino suit for  the  British\n', '\tcharity organisation Save the Rhino International. Puppeteer William Todd-Jones, who had originally worn the suit in the London Marathon to  raise\n', '\tmoney and bring awareness to the group, also participated in the climb wearing a rhino suit; Adams wore the suit while travelling to the  mountain\n', '\tbefore the climb began. About £100,000 was raised through that event, benefiting schools in Kenya and a black rhinoceros preservation programme in\n', '\tTanzania. Adams was also an active supporter of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Since 2003, Save the Rhino has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial\n', '\tLecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.\n', '\n', '\tTechnology and innovation: Adams bought his first word processor in 1982, having considered one as early as 1979. His first purchase was  a  Nexu.\n', '\tIn 1983, when he and Jane Belson went to Los Angeles, he bought a DEC Rainbow. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an Apricot, then  a  BBC\n', '\tMicro and a Tandy 1000. In Last Chance to See Adams mentions his Cambridge Z88, which he had taken to Zaire on a quest to find the northern  white\n', "\trhinoceros. Adams's posthumously published work, The Salmon of Doubt, features several articles by him on the  subject  of  technology,  including\n", '\treprints of articles that originally ran in MacUser magazine, and in The Independent on Sunday newspaper. In these Adams claims that  one  of  the\n', '\tfirst computers he ever saw was a Commodore PET, and that he had "adored" his Apple Macintosh ("or rather my family of however many Macintoshes it\n', '\tis that I\'ve recklessly accumulated over the years") since he first saw one at Infocom\'s offices in Boston in 1984. Adams  was  a  Macintosh  user\n', '\tfrom the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001. He was the first person to buy a Mac in Europe (the  second  being  Stephen Fry\n', '\t– though some accounts differ on this, saying Fry bought his Mac first. Fry claims he was second to Adams).  Adams  was  also  an  "Apple Master",\n', "\tcelebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (others included John Cleese and Gregory Hines). Adams's contributions  included  a\n", "\trock video that he created using the first version of iMovie with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video was available  on  Adams's  .Mac\n", '\thomepage. Adams installed and started using the first release of Mac OS X in the weeks leading up to his death. His very  last  post  to  his  own\n', '\tforum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its Cocoa programming framework. He said it was "awesome...", which  was  also  the  last\n', "\tword he wrote on his site. Adams used email to correspond with Steve Meretzky in the early 1980s, during their collaboration on Infocom's  version\n", "\tof The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his  own  USENET\n", '\tnewsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy. Challenges to the authenticity\n', '\tof his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue. In 1996, Adams  was  a  keynote  speaker  at  the\n', '\tMicrosoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) where he described the personal computer as being a modelling device. The video of his  keynote\n', '\tspeech is archived on Channel 9. Adams was also a keynote speaker for the April 2001 Embedded Systems Conference  in  San Francisco,  one  of  the\n', '\tmajor technical conferences on embedded system engineering.\n', '\n', "\tPersonal life: Adams moved to Upper Street, Islington, in 1981 and to Duncan Terrace, a few minutes' walk away, in the late 1980s.  In  the  early\n", '\t1980s Adams had an affair with novelist Sally Emerson, who was separated from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his  book  Life, the\n', "\tUniverse and Everything to Emerson. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, Peter Stothard, a contemporary of Adams's  at  Brentwood School,  and\n", '\tlater editor of The Times. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved.  Belson  was  the\n', '\t"lady barrister" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [Adams] lives  in  Islington  with  a  lady\n', '\tbarrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on  an  early  screenplay  adaptation  of\n', '\tHitchhiker\'s. When the deal fell through, they moved back to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where  he  lives,\n', '\tor with whom") and a broken engagement, they married on 25 November 1991. Adams and Belson had  one  daughter  together,  Polly Jane Rocket Adams,\n', '\tborn on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999 the family moved from London to Santa Barbara, California, where they lived until his\n', '\tdeath. Following the  funeral,  Jane Belson  and  Polly Adams  returned  to  London.  Belson  died  on  7  September  2011  of  cancer,  aged  59.\n', '\n', '\tDeath and legacy: Adams died of a heart attack on 11 May 2001, aged 49, after resting from his regular workout at  a  private  gym  in  Montecito,\n', '\tCalifornia. Adams had been due to deliver the commencement address at Harvey Mudd College on 13 May. His funeral was  held  on  16  May  in  Santa\n', '\tBarbara. His ashes were placed in Highgate Cemetery in  north  London  in  June  2002.  A  memorial  service  was  held  on  17 September 2001  at\n', '\tSt Martin-in-the-Fields church, Trafalgar Square, London. This became the first church service broadcast live on the web by the  BBC.  Video clips\n', "\tof the service are still available on the BBC's website for download. One of his last public appearances was a talk given  at  the  University  of\n", '\tCalifornia, Santa Barbara, Parrots, the universe and everything, recorded days before his death. A full transcript of the talk is  available,  and\n', '\tthe university has made the full video available on YouTube. Two days before Adams died, the Minor Planet Center announced the naming of  asteroid\n', '\t18610 Arthurdent. In 2005, the asteroid 25924 Douglasadams was named in his memory. In May 2002,  The Salmon of Doubt  was  published,  containing\n', '\tmany short stories, essays, and letters, as well as eulogies from Richard Dawkins, Stephen Fry (in the UK edition), Christopher Cerf  (in  the  US\n', '\tedition), and Terry Jones (in the US paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his unfinished novel, The Salmon of Doubt, which  was\n', "\toriginally intended to become a new Dirk Gently novel, but might have later become the sixth Hitchhiker novel. Other events  after  Adams's  death\n", "\tincluded a webcast production of Shada, allowing the complete story to be told, radio dramatisations of the final three books in the  Hitchhiker's\n", "\tseries, and the completion of the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The film, released in 2005, posthumously credits  Adams\n", "\tas a producer, and several design elements – including a head-shaped planet seen near the end of the  film  –  incorporated  Adams's  features.  A\n", '\t12-part radio series based on the Dirk Gently novels was announced in 2007. BBC Radio 4 also commissioned a third Dirk Gently radio  series  based\n', '\ton the incomplete chapters of The Salmon of Doubt, and written by Kim Fuller; but this was dropped in favour of a BBC TV series based on  the  two\n', '\tcompleted novels. A sixth Hitchhiker novel, And Another Thing..., by Artemis Fowl author Eoin Colfer, was released on 12 October  2009  (the  30th\n', "\tanniversary of the first book), published with the support of Adams's estate.

A prominent series in British popular culture, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  has\n", '\tbecome an international multi-media phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages  by\n', '\t2005. In 2017, BBC Radio 4 announced a 40th-anniversary celebration with Dirk Maggs, one of the original producers, in charge. This  sixth  series\n', "\tof the sci-fi spoof has been based on Eoin Colfer's book And Another Thing, with additional unpublished material by Douglas Adams.  The  first  of\n", '\tsix new episodes was broadcast on 8 March 2018. The broad narrative of Hitchhiker follows the misadventures of  the  last  surviving  man,  Arthur\n', "\tDent, following the demolition of the planet Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued from  Earth's\n", "\tdestruction by Ford Prefect, a human-like  alien  writer  for  the  eccentric,  electronic travel guide  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,  by\n", '\thitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft. Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters  Trillian,  another  human\n', '\tthat had been taken from Earth prior to its destruction by the  President of the Galaxy,  the  two-headed  Zaphod Beeblebrox,  and  the  depressed\n', '\tMarvin, the Paranoid Android. Certain narrative details were changed between the various adaptations.\n', '\n', '\tPlot: The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially\n', '\tfor each new adaptation. Throughout all versions, the  series  follows  the  adventures  of  Arthur Dent,  a  hapless  Englishman,  following  the\n', "\tdestruction of the Earth by the Vogons, a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens, to make way for an intergalactic bypass.  Dent's  adventures\n", '\tintersect with several other characters: Ford Prefect (who named himself after the Ford Prefect car to blend in with what was assumed  to  be  the\n', '\tdominant life form, automobiles), an alien from a small planet somewhere in the  vicinity  of  Betelgeuse  and  a  researcher  for  the  eponymous\n', "\tguidebook, who rescues Dent from Earth's destruction; Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford's eccentric semi-cousin and the  Galactic President;  the  depressed\n", '\trobot Marvin the Paranoid Android; and Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and  the  only\n', "\tother human survivor of Earth's destruction thanks to Beeblebrox' intervention.\n", '\n', '\tBackground: The first radio series comes from a proposal called "The Ends of the Earth": six self-contained  episodes,  all  ending  with  Earth\'s\n', '\tbeing destroyed in a different way. While writing the first episode, Adams realized that he needed someone on the  planet  who  was  an  alien  to\n', '\tprovide some context, and that this alien needed a reason to be there. Adams finally settled on  making  the  alien  a  roving  researcher  for  a\n', '\t"wholly remarkable book" named The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy. As the first radio episode\'s writing progressed, the Guide became the  centre\n', '\tof his story, and he decided to focus the series on it, with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over. Adams claimed that the title  came\n', "\tfrom a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of  the  Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe  book:  while  lying\n", '\tdrunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars, he thought it would be a good idea for  someone  to  write  a\n', "\thitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten  the  incident\n", '\titself, and only remembered himself telling the story. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of "hitch-hiking around  the\n', '\tgalaxy" to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973. Adams\'s fictional Guide  is  an  electronic  guidebook  to  the  entire  universe,  originally\n', '\tpublished by Megadodo Publications, one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta. The narrative of the various versions of the story  are\n', '\tfrequently punctuated with excerpts from the Guide. The voice of the Guide (Peter Jones in the first two  radio  series  and  TV  versions,  later\n', '\tWilliam Franklyn in the third, fourth and  fifth  radio  series,  and  Stephen Fry  in  the  movie  version),  also  provides  general  narration.\n', '\n', '\tOriginal radio series: The first radio series of six episodes (called "Fits" after the names of the sections of Lewis Carroll\'s nonsense poem "The\n', '\tHunting of the Snark") was broadcast in 1978 on BBC Radio 4. Despite a low-key launch of the series (the first episode was broadcast  at  10:30 pm\n', '\ton Wednesday, 8 March 1978), it received generally good reviews and a tremendous audience reaction for radio.  A  one-off  episode  (a  "Christmas\n', '\tspecial") was broadcast later in the year. The BBC had a practice at the time of commissioning  "Christmas Special"  episodes  for  popular  radio\n', '\tseries, and while an early draft of this episode of The Hitchhiker\'s Guide had a Christmas-related plotline, it was  decided  to  be  "in slightly\n', '\tpoor taste" and the episode as transmitted served as a bridge between the two series. This episode was released as part of the second radio series\n', '\tand, later, The Secondary Phase on cassettes and CDs. The Primary and Secondary Phases were aired, in a slightly edited  version,  in  the  United\n', '\tStates on NPR Playhouse. The first series was repeated twice in 1978 alone and many more  times  in  the  next  few  years.  This  led  to  an  LP\n', '\tre-recording, produced independently of the BBC for sale, and a further adaptation of the series as a book. A second radio series, which consisted\n', '\tof a further six episodes, and bringing the total number of episodes to 12, was broadcast in 1980. The radio  series  (and the LP and TV versions)\n', '\tgreatly benefited from the narration of noted comedy actor Peter Jones as The Book. He was cast after it was decided that a "Peter Jonesy" sort of\n', '\tvoice was required. This led to a three-month search for an actor who sounded exactly like Peter Jones, which was unsuccessful. The producers then\n', '\thired Peter Jones as exactly the "Peter Jonesy" voice they were looking for. The series was also notable for its use of  sound,  being  the  first\n', "\tcomedy series to be produced in stereo. Adams said that he wanted the programme's production to be comparable to that of a modern rock album. Much\n", "\tof the programme's budget was spent on sound effects, which were largely the work of Paddy Kingsland (for  the  pilot  episode  and  the  complete\n", '\tsecond series) at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and Dick Mills and Harry Parker (for the remaining  episodes (2–6) of the first series).  The  fact\n', "\tthat they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of Hitchhiker's became some of\n", '\tthe first radio shows to be mixed into four-channel Dolby Surround. This mix was also featured on DVD releases of  the  third  radio  series.  The\n', '\ttheme tune used for the radio, television, LP and film versions is "Journey of the Sorcerer", an instrumental piece composed by Bernie Leadon  and\n', '\trecorded by The Eagles on their album One of These Nights. Only the transmitted radio series used the original recording; a sound-alike  cover  by\n', '\tTim Souster was used for the LP and TV series, another arrangement by Joby Talbot was used for the 2005 film, and still another arrangement,  this\n', '\ttime by Philip Pope, was recorded to be released with the CDs of the  last  three  radio  series.  Apparently,  Adams  chose  this  song  for  its\n', '\tfuturistic-sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it, which, as Geoffrey Perkins recalls, Adams said would give an  "on the\n', '\troad, hitch-hiking feel" to it. The twelve episodes were released (in a slightly edited form, removing the Pink Floyd music and  two  other  tunes\n', '\t"hummed" by Marvin when the team land on Magrathea) on CD and cassette in 1988, becoming the first CD release in  the  BBC Radio Collection.  They\n', '\twere re-released in 1992, and at this time Adams suggested that they could retitle Fits the First to Sixth  as  "The Primary Phase"  and  Fits the\n', '\tSeventh to Twelfth as "The Secondary Phase" instead of just "the first series" and "the second series". It was at about this time that a "Tertiary\n', '\tPhase" was first discussed with Dirk Maggs, adapting Life, the Universe and Everything, but this series would not  be  recorded  for  another  ten\n', '\tyears. Main cast:\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tSimon Jones as Arthur Dent\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tGeoffrey McGivern as Ford Prefect\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tSusan Sheridan as Trillian\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Wing-Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tStephen Moore as Marvin, the Paranoid Android\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tRichard Vernon as Slartibartfast\n', '\t\t\t\t\t\tPeter Jones as The Book\n', '\n', '\tNovels: The novels are described as "a trilogy in five parts", having been described as a trilogy on the release of the  third book,  and  then  a\n', '\t"trilogy in four parts" on the release of the fourth book. The US edition of the fifth book was originally released  with  the  legend  "The fifth\n', '\tbook in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker\'s Trilogy" on the cover. Subsequent re-releases of the other novels bore  the  legend  "The\n', '\t[first, second, third, fourth] book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker\'s Trilogy".  In  addition,  the  blurb  on  the  fifth  book\n', '\tdescribes it as "the book that gives a whole new meaning to the word \'trilogy\'". The plots of the television and radio series are more or less the\n', '\tsame as that of the first two novels, though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed. Much of parts five\n', '\tand six of the radio series were written by John Lloyd, but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not  included\n', "\there. Many consider the books' version of events to be definitive because they are the most readily accessible and widely distributed  version  of\n", '\tthe story. However, they are not the final version that Adams produced. Before his death from a heart attack on 11 May 2001, Adams was considering\n', "\twriting a sixth novel in the Hitchhiker's series. He was working on a third Dirk Gently novel, under the  working  title  The Salmon of Doubt, but\n", "\tfelt that the book was not working and abandoned it. In an interview, he said some of the ideas in the book might fit better  in  the Hitchhiker's\n", '\tseries, and suggested he might rework those ideas into a sixth book in that series. He described Mostly Harmless as "a very bleak book"  and  said\n', '\the "would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note". Adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth instalment, he would  at\n', "\tleast start with all the characters in the same place. Eoin Colfer, who wrote the sixth book in the Hitchhiker's  series  in  2008–09,  used  this\n", '\tlatter concept but none of the plot ideas from The Salmon of Doubt.\n', '\t\n', "\tThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (published in 1979),  the  characters  visit  the  legendary  planet\n", '\tMagrathea, home to the now-collapsed planet-building industry, and meet Slartibartfast, a planetary coastline designer who was responsible for the\n', '\tfjords of Norway. Through archival recordings, he relates the story of a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings  who  built  a  computer\n', '\tnamed Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. When the answer was revealed to be  42,\n', "\tDeep Thought explained that the answer was incomprehensible because the beings didn't know what they were asking.  It  went  on  to  predict  that\n", '\tanother computer, more powerful than itself would be made and designed by it to calculate the question for  the  answer.  (Later  on,  referencing\n', '\tthis, Adams would  create  the 42 Puzzle, a puzzle which could be approached in multiple ways, all yielding the answer 42.)  The  computer,  often\n', '\tmistaken for a planet (because of its size and use of biological components), was the Earth, and was  destroyed  by  Vogons  to  make  way  for  a\n', '\thyperspatial express route five minutes before the conclusion of its 10-million-year  program.  Two  members  of  the  race  of  hyper-intelligent\n', "\tpan-dimensional beings who commissioned the Earth in the first place disguise themselves as Trillian's mice, and want to dissect Arthur's brain to\n", "\thelp reconstruct the question, since he was part of the Earth's matrix moments before it was destroyed, and so he is likely to have  part  of  the\n", '\tquestion buried in his brain. Trillian is also human but had left Earth six months previously with Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy. The\n', '\tprotagonists escape, setting the course for "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe". The mice, in Arthur\'s absence, create  a  phony  question\n', '\tsince it is too troublesome for them to wait 10 million years again just to cash in on a lucrative deal. The book was adapted from the first  four\n', '\tradio episodes. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by Pan Books, after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing\n', '\ta novelization, an action they would later regret. The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold  over  250,000\n', '\tcopies within three months of its release. A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books, a division of Random House in the  United States  in\n', '\tOctober 1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the magazine Rolling Stone to build word  of\n', '\tmouth. In 2005, Del Rey Books rereleased the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie. To date, it  has  sold  over  14\n', '\tmillion copies. A photo-illustrated edition of the first novel appeared in 1994.\n', '\t\n', '\tThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe: In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (published in 1980), Zaphod is separated from  the  others\n', '\tand finds he is part of a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets Zarniwoop, a conspirator and editor for The Guide,  who\n', '\tknows where to find the secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways, the restaurant of the title. Zaphod\n', '\tand Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which turns out to be a stunt ship pre-programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage\n', '\tshow. Unable to change course, the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than  having  no\n', '\tautomatic control (someone must remain behind to operate it), and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself.  Zaphod  and  Trillian  discover  that  the\n', '\tUniverse is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat. Ford and Arthur, meanwhile, end  up  on  a\n', '\tspacecraft full of the outcasts of the Golgafrinchan civilization. The ship crashes on prehistoric Earth; Ford and Arthur  are  stranded,  and  it\n', "\tbecomes clear that the inept Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans,  having  displaced  the  Earth's  indigenous  hominids.  This  has\n", "\tdisrupted the Earth's programming so that when Ford and Arthur manage to extract the final readout from  Arthur's  subconscious  mind  by  pulling\n", '\tlettered tiles from a Scrabble set, it is "What do you get if you multiply six by nine?"  Arthur  then  comments,  "I\'ve  always  said  there  was\n', '\tsomething fundamentally wrong with the universe." The book was adapted from the remaining material in the radio  series—covering  from  the  fifth\n', '\tepisode to the twelfth episode, although the ordering was greatly changed (in particular, the events of Fit the Sixth, with Ford and Arthur  being\n', '\tstranded on pre-historic Earth, end the book, and their rescue in Fit the Seventh is deleted), and most of the Brontitall  incident  was  omitted,\n', '\tinstead of the Haggunenon sequence, co-written by John Loyd, the Disaster Area stunt ship was substituted—this having first been introduced in the\n', '\tLP version.

With the help of Marvin, Zaphod, and Trillian, our heroes prevent the destruction of life in the Universe and go  their\n', "\tseparate ways. This was the first Hitchhiker's book originally written as a book and not adapted from radio. Its story was based  on  a  treatment\n", '\tAdams had written for a Doctor Who theatrical release, with the Doctor role being split between Slartibartfast (to begin with), and later Trillian\n', '\tand Arthur. In 2004 it was adapted for radio as the Tertiary Phase of the radio series.\n', '\t\n', '\tSo Long, and Thanks for All  the  Fish: In So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish  (published  in  1984),  Arthur  returns  home  to  Earth,  rather\n', '\tsurprisingly since it was destroyed when he left. He meets and falls in love  with  a  girl  named  Fenchurch,  and  discovers  this  Earth  is  a\n', '\treplacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually, he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in  the\n', "\tmeantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God's Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android,\n", '\twho, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read  the\n', "\tmessage and feel better about it all before expiring.

In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quandary Phase of the radio series.\n', '\n', "\tMostly Harmless: Finally, in Mostly Harmless  (published  in  1992),  Vogons  take  over  The Hitchhiker's Guide  (under  the  name  of  InfiniDim\n", '\tEnterprises), to finish, once and for all, the task of obliterating the Earth. After abruptly losing Fenchurch and  traveling  around  the  galaxy\n', "\tdespondently, Arthur's spaceship crashes on the planet Lamuella, where he settles in happily as the official sandwich-maker for a small village of\n", "\tsimple, peaceful people. Meanwhile, Ford Prefect breaks into The Guide's offices, gets himself an  infinite  expense  account  from  the  computer\n", "\tsystem, and then meets The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Mark II, an artificially intelligent, multi-dimensional guide with vast  power  and a\n", '\thidden purpose. After he declines this dangerously powerful machine\'s aid (which he receives anyway), he sends it to Arthur Dent for  safety  ("Oh\n', '\tyes, whose?"—Arthur). Trillian uses DNA that Arthur donated for traveling money to have a daughter, and when she goes to cover a war,  she  leaves\n', '\ther daughter Random Frequent Flyer Dent with Arthur. Random, a more than typically troubled teenager, steals The Guide Mark II and uses it to  get\n', '\tto Earth. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Tricia McMillan (Trillian in this alternate universe) follow her to  a  crowded  club,  where  an  anguished\n', '\tRandom becomes startled by a noise and inadvertently fires her gun at Arthur.

All of the main  characters,  save\n', '\tZaphod, were on Earth at the time and are apparently killed, bringing a good deal of satisfaction to the Vogons.

The main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David Dixon as  Ford Prefect  instead  of McGivern, and Sandra\n', '\tDickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.\n', '\t\n', "\tOther television appearances: Segments of several of the books were adapted as part of the BBC's The Big Read survey and programme,  broadcast  in\n", '\tlate 2003. The film, directed by Deep Sehgal, starred Sanjeev Bhaskar as Arthur Dent, alongside Spencer Brown as Ford Prefect, Nigel Planer as the\n', '\tvoice of Marvin, Stephen Hawking as the voice of Deep Thought, Patrick Moore as the voice of the Guide, Roger Lloyd-Pack  as  Slartibartfast,  and\n', '\tAdam Buxton and Joe Cornish as Loonquawl and Phouchg.\n', '\n', "\tRadio series three to five: On 21 June 2004, the BBC announced in a press release that a new series of Hitchhiker's based on the third novel would\n", '\tbe broadcast as part of its autumn schedule, produced by Above the Title Productions Ltd. The episodes were recorded  in  late  2003,  but  actual\n', '\ttransmission was delayed while an agreement was  reached  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  over  Internet  re-broadcasts,  as  Disney  had  begun\n', '\tpre-production on the film. This was followed by news that further series would be produced based on the  fourth  and  fifth  novels.  These  were\n', '\tbroadcast in September and October 2004 and May and June 2005. CD releases accompanied the transmission of the final episode in each  series.  The\n', '\tadaptation of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio  series  in\n', '\tcomparison to the second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur happened in\n', '\ta different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in Mostly  Harmless\n', '\tare now foreshadowed in the adaptation of So Long and Thanks For All The Fish,  while  both  include  some  additional  material  that  builds  on\n', '\tincidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together,  most  especially  including  the  character  Zaphod  more\n', '\tprominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality  to  include  the  events  of  the  Secondary Phase.  While  Mostly  Harmless\n', '\toriginally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending  it  on  a  much  more\n', '\tupbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time. The core cast for the third to fifth radio series remained the same, except for the replacement  of\n', "\tPeter Jones by William Franklyn as the Book, and Richard Vernon by Richard Griffiths as Slartibartfast, since both had  died.  (Homage  to  Jones'\n", '\ticonic portrayal of the Book was paid twice: the gradual shift of voices to a "new" version in episode 13, launching the new  productions,  and  a\n', "\tblend of Jones and Franklyn's voices at the end of the final episode, the first part of Maggs' alternative ending.) Sandra Dickinson,  who  played\n", '\tTrillian in the TV series, here played Tricia McMillan, an English-born, American-accented alternate-universe version  of  Trillian,  while  David\n', '\tDixon, the television series\' Ford Prefect, made a cameo appearance as the "Ecological Man". Jane Horrocks appeared in the new  semi-regular  role\n', "\tof Fenchurch, Arthur's girlfriend, and Samantha Béart joined in the final series as Arthur and Trillian's daughter,  Random Dent.  Also  reprising\n", '\ttheir roles from the original radio series were Jonathan Pryce as Zarniwoop (here blended  with  a  character  from  the  final  novel  to  become\n', '\tZarniwoop Vann Harl), Rula Lenska as Lintilla and her clones (and also as the  Voice  of  the  Bird),  and  Roy  Hudd  as  Milliways  compere  Max\n', "\tQuordlepleen, as well as the original radio series' announcer, John Marsh. The series also featured guest appearances by such noted  personalities\n", '\tas Joanna Lumley as the Sydney Opera House Woman, Jackie Mason as the East River Creature, Miriam Margolyes as the  Smelly Photocopier Woman,  BBC\n', '\tRadio cricket legends Henry Blofeld and Fred Trueman as themselves, June Whitfield as the Raffle Woman,  Leslie Phillips as Hactar,  Saeed Jaffrey\n', '\tas the Man on the Pole, Sir Patrick Moore as himself, and Christian Slater as Wonko the Sane. Finally, Adams himself played the role of Agrajag, a\n', "\tperformance adapted from his book-on-tape reading of the third novel, and edited into the series created  some  time  after  the  author's  death.\n", '\n', '\tTertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phase Main cast:\n', '\t\tSimon Jones as Arthur Dent\n', '\t\tGeoffrey McGivern as Ford Prefect\n', '\t\tSusan Sheridan as Trillian\n', '\t\tMark Wing-Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox\n', '\t\tStephen Moore as Marvin, the Paranoid Android\n', '\t\tRichard Griffiths as Slartibartfast\n', '\t\tSandra Dickinson as Tricia McMillan\n', '\t\tJane Horrocks as Fenchurch\n', '\t\tRula Lenska as the Voice of the Bird\n', '\t\tSamantha Béart as Random\n', '\t\tWilliam Franklyn as The Book\n', '\t\n', '\tRadio series six: The first of six episodes in a sixth series, the Hexagonal  Phase, was broadcast on  BBC Radio 4  on  8 March 2018 and  featured\n', '\tProfessor Stephen Hawking  introducing  himself as the voice of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Mk II  by  saying: "I have been quite popular\n', '\tin my time. Some even read my books."\n', '\n', '\tFilm: After several years of setbacks and renewed efforts to start production and a quarter of a century after the first book  was  published, the\n', "\tbig-screen adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was finally shot. Pre-production began in 2003, filming began on  19 April 2004  and\n", '\tpost-production began in early September 2004. After a London premiere on 20 April 2005, it was released on 28 April in  the  UK and Australia, 29\n', '\tApril in the United States and Canada, and 29 July in South Africa. (A full list of release dates is available  at  the  IMDb.)  The  movie  stars\n', '\tMartin Freeman as Arthur, Mos Def as Ford, Sam Rockwell as President of the  Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian,  with  Alan\n', "\tRickman providing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android (and Warwick Davis acting in Marvin's costume), and Stephen Fry as  the  voice  of  the\n", "\tGuide/Narrator. The plot of the film adaptation of Hitchhiker's Guide differs widely from that of the radio show, book and television  series. The\n", '\tromantic triangle between Arthur, Zaphod, and Trillian is more prominent in the film; and visits to Vogsphere, the homeworld of the Vogons (which,\n', '\tin the books, was already abandoned), and Viltvodle VI are inserted. The film covers roughly events in  the  first four radio episodes,  and  ends\n', '\twith the characters en route to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, leaving the opportunity for a sequel open. A unique appearance is  made\n', '\tby the Point-of-View Gun, a device specifically created by Adams himself for the movie. Commercially the film was a  modest  success,  taking  $21\n', '\tmillion in its opening weekend in the United States, and nearly £3.3 million in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom. The film  was  released\n', '\ton DVD (Region 2, PAL) in the UK on 5 September 2005. Both a standard double-disc edition and a UK-exclusive numbered  limited edition  "Giftpack"\n', '\twere released on this date. The "Giftpack" edition includes a copy of the novel with a "movie tie-in" cover, and collectible prints from the film,\n', "\tpackaged in a replica of the film's version of the Hitchhiker's Guide prop. A single-disc widescreen or full-screen edition (Region 1, NTSC)  were\n", '\tmade available in the United States and Canada on 13 September 2005. Single-disc releases in the Blu-ray format and UMD format for the PlayStation\n', '\tPortable were also released on the respective dates in these three countries.\n', '\t\n', "\tStage shows: There have been multiple professional and amateur stage adaptations of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. There were  three  early\n", '\tprofessional productions, which were staged in 1979 and 1980. The first of these was performed  at  the  Institute of Contemporary Arts in London,\n', "\tbetween 1 and 19 May 1979, starring Chris Langham as Arthur Dent (Langham later returned to Hitchhiker's as Prak in the final  episode  of  2004's\n", "\tTertiary Phase) and Richard Hope as Ford Prefect. This show was adapted from the first series' scripts and was directed by Ken Campbell, who  went\n", '\ton to perform a character in the final episode of the second radio series. The show ran 90 minutes, but had an audience limited to  eighty  people\n', '\tper night. Actors performed on a variety of ledges and platforms, and the audience was pushed around in a hovercar, 1/2000th of an inch above  the\n', '\tfloor. This was the first time that Zaphod was represented by having two actors in one large  costume.  The  narration  of  "The Book"  was  split\n', '\tbetween two usherettes, an adaptation that has appeared in no other version of H2G2. One of  these  usherettes,  Cindy Oswin,  went  on  to  voice\n', '\tTrillian for the LP adaptation. The second stage show was  performed  throughout  Wales  between  15 January  and  23 February 1980.  This  was  a\n', '\tproduction of Clwyd Theatr Cymru, and was directed by Jonathan Petherbridge. The company performed adaptations  of  complete  radio  episodes,  at\n', '\ttimes doing two episodes in a night, and at other times doing all six episodes of the first series in single three-hour sessions. This  adaptation\n', "\twas performed again at the Oxford Playhouse in December 1981, the Bristol Hippodrome, Plymouth's Theatre Royal in May–June 1982, and also  at  the\n", '\tBelgrade Theatre, Coventry, in July 1983. The third and least successful stage show was held at the Rainbow Theatre in London, in July 1980.  This\n', '\twas the second production directed by Ken Campbell. The Rainbow Theatre had been adapted for stagings of  rock  operas  in  the  1970s,  and  both\n', '\treference books mentioned in footnotes indicate that this, coupled with incidental music throughout the  performance,  caused  some  reviewers  to\n', '\tlabel it as a "musical". This was the first adaptation for which Adams wrote the "Dish of the Day" sequence. The production  ran  for  over  three\n', '\thours, and was widely panned for this, as well as for the music, laser effects, and the acting. Despite attempts to shorten the script,  and  make\n', '\tother changes, it closed three or four weeks early (accounts differ), and lost a lot of money. Despite the bad reviews, there were  at  least  two\n', '\tstand-out performances: Michael Cule and David Learner both went on from this production to appearances in the  TV adaptation. In  December 2011 a\n', '\tnew stage production was announced to begin touring in June 2012. This included members of the original radio and TV casts  such  as  Simon Jones,\n', '\tGeoff McGivern, Susan Sheridan, Mark Wing-Davey and Stephen Moore with VIP guests playing the role of the Book. It was produced in the form  of  a\n', '\tradio show which could be downloaded when the tour was completed. This production was based on the first four Fits in  the  first  act,  with  the\n', '\tsecond act covering material from the rest of the series. The show also featured a band, who performed the songs  "Share and Enjoy",  the  Krikkit\n', '\tsong "Under the Ink Black Sky", Marvin\'s song "How I Hate The Night", and "Marvin", which was a minor hit  in  1981.  The  production  featured  a\n', '\tseries of "VIP guests" as the voice of  The Book  including  Billy Boyd,  Phill Jupitus,  Rory McGrath,  Roger McGough,  Jon Culshaw,  Christopher\n', '\tTimothy, Andrew Sachs, John Challis, Hugh Dennis, John Lloyd, Terry Jones and Neil Gaiman. The tour started on 8 June 2012 at  the  Theatre Royal,\n', '\tGlasgow and continued through the summer until 21 July when the final performance was at  Playhouse Theatre,  Edinburgh.  The  production  started\n', '\ttouring again in September 2013, but the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\n', '\t\n', '\tLive radio adaptation: On Saturday 29 March 2014, Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation in front of a live  audience,  featuring  many  members  of  the\n', '\toriginal cast including Stephen Moore, Susan Sheridan,  Mark Wing-Davey,  Simon Jones  and  Geoff McGivern,  with  John Lloyd  as  the  book.  The\n', '\tadaptation was adapted by Dirk Maggs primarily from Fit the First, including material from the books and later radio Fits  as  well  as  some  new\n', "\tjokes. It formed part of Radio 4's Character Invasion series. \n", '\t\n', "\tLP album adaptations: The first four radio episodes were adapted for a new double LP, also entitled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (appended\n", '\twith "Part One" for the subsequent Canadian release), first by mail-order only, and  later  into  stores.  The  double  LP  and  its  sequel  were\n', '\toriginally released by Original Records in the United Kingdom in 1979 and 1980, with the catalogue numbers ORA042  and  ORA054  respectively. They\n', '\twere first released by Hannibal Records in 1982 (as HNBL 2301 and HNBL 1307, respectively) in the United States and Canada, and later  re-released\n', "\tin a slightly abridged edition by Simon & Schuster's Audioworks in the mid-1980s. Both  were  produced  by  Geoffrey Perkins  and  featured  cover\n", '\tartwork by Hipgnosis. The script in the first double LP very closely follows the first four radio episodes, although further cuts had to  be  made\n', '\tfor reasons of timing. Despite this, other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when  the  original  scripts  from  the  radio\n', '\tseries were eventually published can be  heard  in  the  LP  version.  The  Simon & Schuster  cassettes  omit  the  Veet Voojagig  narration,  the\n', "\tcheerleader's speech as Deep Thought concludes its seven-and-one-half-million-year programme, and a few other lines from both sides of the  second\n", '\tLP of the set. Most of the original cast returned, except for Susan Sheridan, who was recording a voice for the character of  Princess Eilonwy  in\n', '\tThe Black Cauldron for Walt Disney Pictures. Cindy Oswin voiced Trillian on all three LPs in her place. Other casting changes in the  first double\n', "\tLP included Stephen Moore taking on the additional role of the barman, and Valentine Dyall as the voice of  Deep Thought.  Adams's  voice  can  be\n", '\theard making the public address announcements on Magrathea. Because of copyright issues, the music used during the first radio series  was  either\n', '\treplaced, or in the case of the title it was re-recorded in a  new  arrangement.  Composer  Tim Souster  did  both  duties  (with  Paddy Kingsland\n', "\tcontributing music as well), and Souster's version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series.  The  sequel LP  was\n", "\treleased, singly, as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Part Two: The Restaurant at the End of the  Universe  in  the  UK,  and  simply  as  The\n", '\tRestaurant at the End of the Universe in the USA. The script here mostly follows Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth,  but  includes  a  song  by  the\n', '\tbackup band in the restaurant ("Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo"), and changes the Haggunenon sequence to "Disaster Area". As the result  of\n', '\ta misunderstanding, the second record was released before being cut down in a final edit that Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins had both intended\n', '\tto make. Perkins has said, "[I]t is far too long on each side. It\'s  just  a  rough cut. [...] I felt it was flabby, and I wanted to speed it up."\n', '\tThe Simon & Schuster Audioworks re-release of this LP was also abridged slightly from its  original  release.  The  scene  with  Ford Prefect  and\n', "\tHotblack Desiato's bodyguard is omitted. Sales for the first double-LP release were primarily through mail order. Total sales reached over  60,000\n", "\tunits, with half of those being mail order, and the other half through retail outlets. This  is  in  spite  of  the  facts  that Original Records'\n", '\twarehouse ordered and stocked more copies than they were actually selling for quite some time, and that Paul Neil Milne Johnstone complained about\n', '\this name and then-current address being included in the recording. This was corrected for a later pressing of the double-LP by "cut[ting] up  that\n', '\tpart of the master tape and reassembl[ing] it in the wrong order". The second LP release ("Part Two") also only sold a total of  60,000  units  in\n', '\tthe UK. The distribution deals for the United States and Canada with Hannibal Records and Simon and Schuster  were  later  negotiated  by  Douglas\n', '\tAdams and his agent, Ed Victor, after gaining full rights to the recordings from Original Records, which went bankrupt.\n', '\n', '\tAudiobook adaptations: There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition  (ISBN 0-671-62964-6),  recorded\n', '\tin the mid-1980s for the EMI label Music For Pleasure by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice  of  Marvin the Paranoid Android  in  the\n', '\tradio series and in the TV series. In 1990,  Adams  himself  recorded  an  unabridged  edition  for  Dove Audiobooks  (ISBN 1-55800-273-1),  later\n', '\tre-released by New Millennium Audio (ISBN 1-59007-257-X)  in  the  United States  and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. Also by\n', '\tarrangement with Dove, ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by Douglas Adams (ISBN 1-85695-028-X) in 1994.  To  tie-in\n', "\twith the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film's voice of the Guide, recorded a second  unabridged  edition  (ISBN 0-7393-2220-6).  In  addition,\n", '\tunabridged versions of books 2-5 of the  series were recorded by Martin Freeman for Random House Audio. Freeman plays  Arthur  in  the  2005  film\n', '\tadaptation. Audiobooks 2-5 follow in order  and  include: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (ISBN 9780739332085);  Life, the Universe, and\n', '\tEverything (ISBN 9780739332108); So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (ISBN 9780739332122); and Mostly Harmless (ISBN 9780739332146).\n', '\n', '\tInteractive fiction and video games: Sometime between 1982 and 1984  (accounts differ), the  British  company  Supersoft  published  a  text-based\n', '\tadventure game based on the book, which was released in versions for the Commodore PET and Commodore 64. One  account  states  that  there  was  a\n', '\tdispute as to whether valid permission for publication had been granted, and following legal action the  game  was  withdrawn  and  all  remaining\n', "\tcopies were destroyed. Another account states that the programmer, Bob Chappell, rewrote the game  to  remove  all  Hitchhiker's  references,  and\n", '\trepublished it as "Cosmic Capers". Officially, the TV series was followed in 1984 by a best-selling "interactive fiction", or text-based adventure\n', "\tgame, distributed by Infocom. It was designed by Adams and Infocom regular Steve Meretzky and was one of Infocom's most successful games. As  with\n", '\tmany Infocom games, the box contained a number of "feelies" including a  "Don\'t panic" badge,  some  "pocket fluff",  a  pair  of  peril-sensitive\n', '\tsunglasses (made of cardboard), an order for the destruction of the Earth, a small, clear plastic bag containing "a microscopic battle fleet"  and\n', "\tan order for the destruction of Arthur Dent's house  (signed by Adams and Meretzky).  In  September 2004,  it  was  revived  by  the  BBC  on  the\n", "\tHitchhiker's section of the Radio 4 website for the initial broadcast of the Tertiary Phase, and is still  available  to  play  online.  This  new\n", '\tversion uses an original Infocom datafile with a custom-written interpreter, by Sean Sollé, and Flash programming by Shimon Young,  both  of  whom\n', '\tused to work at The Digital Village (TDV). The new version includes illustrations by Rod Lord, who was head of Pearce Animation Studios  in  1980,\n', '\twhich produced the guide graphics for the TV series. On 2 March 2005 it won the Interactive BAFTA in the "best online entertainment"  category.  A\n', '\tsequel to the original Infocom game was never made. An all-new, fully graphical game was designed and developed by a  joint  venture  between  The\n', '\tDigital Village and PAN Interactive (no connection to Pan Books / Pan Mcmillan). This new game was planned and  developed  between  1998 and 2002,\n', '\tbut like the sequel to the Infocom game, it also never materialised. In April 2005, Starwave Mobile released two mobile  games  to  accompany  the\n', '\trelease of the film adaptation. The first, developed by Atatio, was called "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy: Vogon Planet Destructor". It was\n', '\ta typical top-down shooter and except for the title had little to do with the actual story. The second game,  developed  by  TKO Software,  was  a\n', '\tgraphical adventure game named "The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game". Despite  its  name,  the  newly  designed  puzzles  by  TKO\n', "\tSoftware's Ireland studio were different from the Infocom ones, and the game followed the movie's script closely and included the  new  characters\n", '\tand places. The "Adventure Game" won the IGN\'s "Editors\' Choice Award" in May 2005. On 25 May 2011, Hothead Games announced they were working on a\n', '\tnew edition of The Guide. Along with the announcement, Hothead Games launched a teaser web site made to look like an  announcement  from  Megadodo\n', '\tPublications that The Guide will soon be available on Earth. It has since been revealed that they are developing an iOS app in the  style  of  the\n', '\tfictional Guide.\n', '\t\n', '\tComic books: In 1993, DC Comics, in conjunction with Byron Preiss Visual Publications,  published  a  three-part  comic  book  adaptation  of  the\n', "\tnovelisation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This was followed up with three-part adaptations  of  The  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the\n", "\tUniverse in 1994, and Life, the Universe and Everything in 1996. There was also a series of collectors' cards with art from and  inspired  by  the\n", '\tcomic adaptations of the first book, and a graphic novelisation (or "collected edition") combining the three individual  comic  books  from  1993,\n', '\titself released in May 1997. Douglas Adams was deeply opposed to the use of American English spellings and idioms in  what  he  felt  was  a  very\n', '\tBritish story, and had to be talked into it by the American publishers, although he remained very unhappy with  the  compromise.  The  adaptations\n', "\twere scripted by John Carnell. Steve Leialoha provided the art for Hitchhiker's and the layouts for Restaurant. Shepherd Hendrix did the  finished\n", '\tart for Restaurant. Neil Vokes and John Nyberg did the finished artwork for Life, based on breakdowns by Paris Cullins  (Book 1)  and  Christopher\n', '\tSchenck (Books 2–3). The miniseries were edited by Howard Zimmerman and Ken Grobe.\n', '\t\n', '\t"Hitch-Hikeriana": Many merchandising and spin-off items (or "Hitch-Hikeriana") were produced in the early 1980s, including  towels  in  different\n', '\tcolours, all bearing the Guide entry for towels. Later runs of towels include those made for promotions by Pan Books, Touchstone Pictures / Disney\n', "\tfor the 2005 movie, and different towels made for ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha,  the official Hitchhiker's Appreciation  society.  Other  items  that  first\n", '\tappeared in the mid-1980s were T-shirts, including those made for Infocom (such as one bearing the legend "I got the Babel Fish" for  successfully\n', '\tcompleting one of that game\'s most difficult puzzles), and a Disaster Area tour T-shirt. Other official items have included  "Beeblebears"  (teddy\n', "\tbears with an extra head and arm, named after Hitchhiker's character Zaphod Beeblebrox, sold by the official Appreciation Society), an  assortment\n", '\tof pin-on buttons and a number of novelty singles. Many of the above items  are  displayed  throughout  the  2004  "25th  Anniversary  Illustrated\n', '\tEdition" of the novel, which used items from the personal collections of fans of the  series.  Stephen  Moore  recorded  two  novelty  singles  in\n', '\tcharacter as Marvin, the Paranoid Android: "Marvin"/"Metal Man" and "Reasons To Be Miserable"/"Marvin I Love You". The last song has appeared on a\n', '\tDr. Demento compilation. Another single featured the re-recorded "Journey of the Sorcerer" (arranged by Tim Souster) backed  with  "Reg Nullify In\n', '\tConcert" by Reg Nullify, and "Only the End of the World Again" by Disaster Area (including Douglas Adams on bass guitar). These  discs  have since\n', "\tbecome collector's items.  The 2005 movie also added quite a few collectibles, mostly through the National Entertainment Collectibles Association.\n", '\tThese included three prop  replicas  of objects seen on the Vogon ship and homeworld (a mug, a pen and a stapler), sets of "action figures" with a\n', '\theight of either 3 or 6 inches (76 or 150 mm), a gun—based on a prop used by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, that shoots foam darts, a crystal cube,\n', '\tshot glasses, a ten-inch (254 mm) high version of  Marvin  with  eyes  that light up green, and "yarn doll" versions of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect,\n', '\tTrillian, Marvin and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Also, various audio tracks were released to coincide with the movie, notably re-recordings of "Marvin" and\n', '\t"Reasons To Be Miserable", sung by Stephen Fry, along with some of the "Guide Entries",  newly  written  material read in-character by Fry. SpaceX\n', '\tCEO Elon Musk launched his Tesla Roadster into an elliptical heliocentric orbit as part of the initial test launch of  the  Falcon Heavy.  On  the\n', '\tcar\'s dashboard, the phrase "Don\'t Panic!" appears, as a nod to the Hitchhiker\'s Guide.\n', '\t\n', "\tInternational phenomenon: Many science fiction fans and radio listeners outside the United Kingdom were first exposed to The Hitchhiker's Guide to\n", '\tthe Galaxy in one of two ways: shortwave radio broadcasts of the original radio series, or by Douglas Adams being "Guest of Honour"  at  the  1979\n', '\tWorld Science Fiction Convention, Seacon, held in Brighton, England. It was there that the radio series was nominated for a Hugo Award (the  first\n', '\tradio series to receive a nomination) but lost to Superman.
