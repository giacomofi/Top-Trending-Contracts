Intro\n', '*\n', '* CryptoCanvas is a set of collectible artworks (“Canvas”) created by the CryptoCanvas community with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n', '*\n', '* This agreement does a few things. First, it passes copyright ownership of a Canvas from the Canvas Authors to the first Canvas Owner. The first Canvas Owner is then obligated to pass on the copyright ownership along with the Canvas to the next owner, and so on forever, such that each owner of a Canvas is also the copyright owner. Second, it requires each Canvas Owner to allow certain uses of their Canvas image. Third, it limits the rights of Canvas owners to sue The Mindhouse and the prior owners of the Canvas.\n', '*\n', '* Canvases of CryptoCanvas are not an investment. They are experimental digital art.\n', '*\n', '* PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.\n', '*\n', '* 2. Definitions\n', '*\n', '* “Smart Contract” refers to this smart contract.\n', '*\n', '* “Canvas” means a collectible artwork created by the CryptoCanvas community with information about the color and author of each pixel of the Canvas, and proof of ownership stored in the Smart Contract. The Canvas is considered finished when all the pixels of the Canvas have their color set. Specifically, the Canvas is considered finished when its “state” field in the Smart Contract equals to STATE_INITIAL_BIDDING or STATE_OWNED constant.\n', '*\n', '* “Canvas Author” means the person who painted at least one final pixel of the finished Canvas by sending a transaction to the Smart Contract. Specifically, Canvas Author means the person with the private key for at least one address in the “painter” field of the “pixels” field of the applicable Canvas in the Smart Contract.\n', '*\n', '* “Canvas Owner” means the person that can cryptographically prove ownership of the applicable Canvas. Specifically, Canvas Owner means the person with the private key for the address in the “owner” field of the applicable Canvas in the Smart Contract. The person is the Canvas Owner only after the Initial Bidding phase is finished, that is when the field “state” of the applicable Canvas equals to the STATE_OWNED constant.\n', '*\n', '* “Initial Bidding” means the state of the Canvas when each of its pixels has been set by Canvas Authors but it does not have the Canvas Owner yet. In this phase any user can claim the ownership of the Canvas by sending a transaction to the Smart Contract (a “Bid”). Other users have 48 hours from the time of making the first Bid on the Canvas to submit their own Bids. After that time, the user who sent the highest Bid becomes the sole Canvas Owner of the applicable Canvas. Users who placed Bids with lower amounts are able to withdraw their Bid amount from their Account Balance.\n', '*\n', '* “Account Balance” means the value stored in the Smart Contract assigned to an address. The Account Balance can be withdrawn by the person with the private key for the applicable address by sending a transaction to the Smart Contract. Account Balance consists of Rewards for painting, Bids from Initial Bidding which have been overbid, cancelled offers to buy a Canvas and profits from selling a Canvas.\n', '*\n', '* “The Mindhouse”, “we” or “us” is the group of developers who created and published the CryptoCanvas Smart Contract.\n', '*\n', '* “The App” means collectively the Smart Contract and the website created by The Mindhouse to interact with the Smart Contract.\n', '*\n', '* 3. Intellectual Property\n', '*\n', '* A. First Assignment\n', '* The Canvas Authors of the applicable Canvas hereby assign all copyright ownership in the Canvas to the Canvas Owner. In exchange for this copyright ownership, the Canvas Owner agrees to the terms below.\n', '*\n', '* B. Later Assignments\n', '* When the Canvas Owner transfers the Canvas to a new owner, the Canvas Owner hereby agrees to assign all copyright ownership in the Canvas to the new owner of the Canvas. In exchange for these rights, the new owner shall agree to become the Canvas Owner, and shall agree to be subject to this Terms of Use.\n', '*\n', '* C. No Other Assignments.\n', '* The Canvas Owner shall not assign or license the copyright except as set forth in the “Later Assignments” section above.\n', '*\n', '* D. Third Party Permissions.\n', '* The Canvas Owner agrees to allow CryptoCanvas fans to make non-commercial Use of images of the Canvas to discuss CryptoCanvas, digital collectibles and related matters. “Use” means to reproduce, display, transmit, and distribute images of the Canvas. This permission excludes the right to print the Canvas onto physical copies (including, for example, shirts and posters).\n', '*\n', '* 4. Fees and Payment\n', '*\n', '* A. If you choose to paint, make a bid or trade any Canvas of CryptoCanvas any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.\n', '*\n', '* B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.\n', '*\n', '* C. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you sell a Canvas to another user of the App, you authorize us to collect a fee of 10% of the total value of that transaction. That fee consists of:\n', '        1) 3.9% of the total value of that transaction (a “Commission”). You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred to us through the Ethereum network as a part of the payment.\n', '        2) 6.1% of the total value of that transaction (a “Reward”). You acknowledge and agree that the Reward will be transferred evenly to all painters of the sold canvas through the Ethereum network as a part of the payment.\n', '\n', '*\n', '* D. If you are the Canvas Author you are eligible to receive a reward for painting a Canvas (a “Reward”). A Reward is distributed in these scenarios:\n', '        1) After the Initial Bidding phase is completed. You acknowledge and agree that the Reward for the Canvas Author will be calculated by dividing the value of the winning Bid, decreased by our commission of 3.9% of the total value of the Bid, by the total number of pixels of the Canvas and multiplied by the number of pixels of the Canvas that have been painted by applicable Canvas Author.\n', '        2) Each time the Canvas is sold. You acknowledge and agree that the Reward for the Canvas Author will be calculated by dividing 6.1% of the total transaction value by the total number of pixels of the Canvas and multiplied by the number of pixels of the Canvas that have been painted by the applicable Canvas Author.\n', 'You acknowledge and agree that in order to withdraw the Reward you first need to add the Reward to your Account Balance by sending a transaction to the Smart Contract.\n', '\n', '*\n', '* 5.

Intro\n', '*\n', '* CryptoCanvas is a set of collectible artworks (“Canvas”) created by the CryptoCanvas community with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain.\n', '*\n', '* This agreement does a few things. First, it passes copyright ownership of a Canvas from the Canvas Authors to the first Canvas Owner. The first Canvas Owner is then obligated to pass on the copyright ownership along with the Canvas to the next owner, and so on forever, such that each owner of a Canvas is also the copyright owner. Second, it requires each Canvas Owner to allow certain uses of their Canvas image. Third, it limits the rights of Canvas owners to sue The Mindhouse and the prior owners of the Canvas.\n', '*\n', '* Canvases of CryptoCanvas are not an investment. They are experimental digital art.\n', '*\n', '* PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU.

Definitions\n', '*\n', '* “Smart Contract” refers to this smart contract.\n', '*\n', '* “Canvas” means a collectible artwork created by the CryptoCanvas community with information about the color and author of each pixel of the Canvas, and proof of ownership stored in the Smart Contract. The Canvas is considered finished when all the pixels of the Canvas have their color set. Specifically, the Canvas is considered finished when its “state” field in the Smart Contract equals to STATE_INITIAL_BIDDING or STATE_OWNED constant.\n', '*\n', '* “Canvas Author” means the person who painted at least one final pixel of the finished Canvas by sending a transaction to the Smart Contract. Specifically, Canvas Author means the person with the private key for at least one address in the “painter” field of the “pixels” field of the applicable Canvas in the Smart Contract.\n', '*\n', '* “Canvas Owner” means the person that can cryptographically prove ownership of the applicable Canvas. Specifically, Canvas Owner means the person with the private key for the address in the “owner” field of the applicable Canvas in the Smart Contract. The person is the Canvas Owner only after the Initial Bidding phase is finished, that is when the field “state” of the applicable Canvas equals to the STATE_OWNED constant.\n', '*\n', '* “Initial Bidding” means the state of the Canvas when each of its pixels has been set by Canvas Authors but it does not have the Canvas Owner yet. In this phase any user can claim the ownership of the Canvas by sending a transaction to the Smart Contract (a “Bid”). Other users have 48 hours from the time of making the first Bid on the Canvas to submit their own Bids. After that time, the user who sent the highest Bid becomes the sole Canvas Owner of the applicable Canvas. Users who placed Bids with lower amounts are able to withdraw their Bid amount from their Account Balance.\n', '*\n', '* “Account Balance” means the value stored in the Smart Contract assigned to an address. The Account Balance can be withdrawn by the person with the private key for the applicable address by sending a transaction to the Smart Contract. Account Balance consists of Rewards for painting, Bids from Initial Bidding which have been overbid, cancelled offers to buy a Canvas and profits from selling a Canvas.\n', '*\n', '* “The Mindhouse”, “we” or “us” is the group of developers who created and published the CryptoCanvas Smart Contract.\n', '*\n', '* “The App” means collectively the Smart Contract and the website created by The Mindhouse to interact with the Smart Contract.\n', '*\n', '* 3. Intellectual Property\n', '*\n', '* A. First Assignment\n', '* The Canvas Authors of the applicable Canvas hereby assign all copyright ownership in the Canvas to the Canvas Owner.

If you choose to paint, make a bid or trade any Canvas of CryptoCanvas any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.\n', '*\n', '* B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.\n', '*\n', '* C. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you sell a Canvas to another user of the App, you authorize us to collect a fee of 10% of the total value of that transaction. That fee consists of:\n', '        1) 3.9% of the total value of that transaction (a “Commission”). You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred to us through the Ethereum network as a part of the payment.\n', '        2) 6.1% of the total value of that transaction (a “Reward”).

If you are the Canvas Author you are eligible to receive a reward for painting a Canvas (a “Reward”). A Reward is distributed in these scenarios:\n', '        1) After the Initial Bidding phase is completed. You acknowledge and agree that the Reward for the Canvas Author will be calculated by dividing the value of the winning Bid, decreased by our commission of 3.9% of the total value of the Bid, by the total number of pixels of the Canvas and multiplied by the number of pixels of the Canvas that have been painted by applicable Canvas Author.\n', '        2) Each time the Canvas is sold.
