This\n', '    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n', '    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n', '    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n', '    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n', '    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n', '\n', '    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n', '    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n', '    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n', '    work need not make them do so.\n', '\n', '  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n', 'works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n', 'and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n', 'in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n', '"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n', "used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n", 'beyond what the individual works permit.

A product\n', 'is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n', 'commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n', 'the only significant mode of use of the product.\n', '\n', '  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\n', 'procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n', 'and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n', 'a modified version of its Corresponding Source.

Additional Terms.\n', '\n', '  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n', 'License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n', 'Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n', 'be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n', 'that they are valid under applicable law.

If the Program as you\n', 'received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n', 'governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n', 'restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n', 'a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n', 'License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n', 'of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n', 'not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n', '\n', '  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n', 'must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n', 'additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n', 'where to find the applicable terms.\n', '\n', '  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n', 'form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n', 'the above requirements apply either way.\n', '\n', '  8. Termination.\n', '\n', '  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n', 'provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n', 'modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n', 'this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n', 'paragraph of section 11).\n', '\n', '  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n', 'license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n', 'provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n', 'finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n', 'holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n', 'prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n', '\n', '  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n', 'reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n', 'violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n', 'received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n', 'copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n', 'your receipt of the notice.\n', '\n', '  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n', 'licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n', 'this License.

Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n', '\n', '  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n', 'run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n', 'occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n', 'to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n', 'nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n', 'modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n', 'not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n', 'covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n', '\n', '  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n', '\n', '  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n', 'receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n', 'propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n', 'for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n', '\n', '  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\n', 'organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n', 'organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n', 'work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n', 'transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n', "licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n", 'give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n', 'Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n', 'the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n', '\n', '  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n', 'rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n', 'not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n', 'rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n', '(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n', 'any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n', 'sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n', '\n', '  11. Patents.\n', '\n', '  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n', 'License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
